	abstract = {The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation field from a coupled atmosphere-ocean system (CAOS) includes contributions from the atmosphere, surface, and water body. Atmospheric correction of ocean color imagery is to retrieve water-leaving radiance from the TOA measurement, from which ocean bio-optical properties can be obtained. Knowledge of the absolute and relative magnitudes of water-leaving signal in the TOA radiation field is important for designing new atmospheric correction algorithms and developing retrieval algorithms for new ocean biogeochemical parameters. In this paper we present a systematic sensitivity study of water-leaving contribution to the TOA radiation field, from 340 nm to 865 nm, with polarization included. Ocean water inherent optical properties are derived from bio-optical models for two kinds of waters, one dominated by phytoplankton (PDW) and the other by non-algae particles (NDW). In addition to elastic scattering, Raman scattering and fluorescence from dissolved organic matter in ocean waters are included. Our sensitivity study shows that the polarized reflectance is minimized for both CAOS and ocean signals in the backscattering half plane, which leads to numerical instability when calculating water leaving relative contribution, the ratio between polarized water leaving and CAOS signals. If the backscattering plane is excluded, the water-leaving polarized signal contributes less than 9\&\#x00025; to the TOA polarized reflectance for PDW in the whole spectra. For NDW, the polarized water leaving contribution can be as much as 20\&\#x00025; in the wavelength range from 470 to 670 nm. For wavelengths shorter than 452 nm or longer than 865 nm, the water leaving contribution to the TOA polarized reflectance is in general smaller than 5\&\#x00025; for NDW. For the TOA total reflectance, the water-leaving contribution has maximum values ranging from 7\&\#x00025; to 16\&\#x00025; at variable wavelengths from 400 nm to 550 nm from PDW. The water leaving contribution to the TOA total reflectance can be as large as 35\&\#x00025; for NDW, which is in general peaked at 550 nm. Both the total and polarized reflectances from water-leaving contributions approach zero in the ultraviolet and near infrared bands. These facts can be used as constraints or guidelines when estimating the water leaving contribution to the TOA reflectance for new atmospheric correction algorithms for ocean color imagery.},

The results of a polarization resolving Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations are presented.

The variability of the polarization signal is largest in the direction looking towards the sun which is unfortunate due to sun reflection. However the variability is also significant at direction perpendicular to solar azimuth angle which should it make possible to use this signal in remote sensing.

Transfer functions for surface-reflected skylight and upward transmission of light through the sea surface are presented for many common viewing and solar geometries for clear-sky conditions. Sensitivity of reflection matrices to environmental conditions is examined and can vary up to 50\% due to wind speed, 25\% due to atmospheric aerosol load, and 10\% due to radiometer field-of-view. Scalar transmission is largely independent of water type and varies a few percent with wind speed, while polarized components can change up to 10\% in high winds.

	abstract = {Above-water measurements of water-leaving radiance are widely used for water-quality monitoring and ocean-color satellite data validation. Reflected skylight in above-water radiometry needs to be accurately estimated prior to derivation of water-leaving radiance. Up-to-date methods to estimate reflection of diffuse skylight on rough sea surfaces are based on radiative transfer simulations and sky radiance measurements. But these methods neglect the polarization state of the incident skylight, which is generally highly polarized. In this paper, the effects of polarization on the sea surface reflectance and the subsequent water-leaving radiance estimation are investigated. We show that knowledge of the polarization field of the diffuse skylight significantly improves above-water radiometry estimates, in particular in the blue part of the spectrum where the reflected skylight is dominant. A newly developed algorithm based on radiative transfer simulations including polarization is described. Its application to the standard Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color and hyperspectral radiometric measurements of the 1.5-year dataset acquired at the Long Island Sound site demonstrates the noticeable importance of considering polarization for water-leaving radiance estimation. In particular it is shown, based on time series of collocated data acquired in coastal waters, that the azimuth range of measurements leading to good-quality data is significantly increased, and that these estimates are improved by more than 12\% at 413\&\#xA0;nm. Full consideration of polarization effects is expected to significantly improve the quality of the field data utilized for satellite data validation or potential vicarious calibration purposes.},

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulation is performed for the interaction between a deformable free surface and the homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow underneath. The Navier–Stokes equations subject to fully nonlinear free-surface boundary conditions are simulated by using a pseudospectral method in the horizontal directions and a finite-difference method in the vertical direction. Statistically, steady turbulence is generated by using a linear forcing method in the bulk flow below. Through investigation of cases of different Froude and Weber numbers, the present study focuses on the effect of surface deformation of finite amplitude. It is found that the motion of the free surface is characterized by propagating waves and turbulence-generated surface roughness. Statistics of the turbulence field near the free surface are analysed in detail in terms of fluctuations of velocity, fluctuations of velocity gradients and strain rates and the energy budget for horizontal and vertical turbulent motions. Our results illustrate the effects of surface blockage and vanishing shear stress on the anisotropy of the flow field. Using conditional averaging analysis, it is shown that splats and antisplats play an essential role in energy inter-component exchange and vertical transport.},

Distributions of the total kinetic energy of the coherent structures as a function of size showed that the most energetic eddies occurred in the size range 0.8–1.6 cm in diameter. The near‐surface flow could be divided into areas with one of two distinct characteristics: energetic regions occupied by coherent structures and quiescent regions largely devoid of coherent structures. A surface renewal model for air‐water exchange was used to calculate the local transfer velocity in both types of regions. The model predicted that the gas transfer velocities in the energetic regions were 2.8 times larger than in the quiescent regions and that 60\% of the total air‐water gas flux occurred across the energetic regions at all wind speeds. In addition, the rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation was ∼2.5 times higher in the energetic regions compared to the quiescent regions at all wind speeds.},

In addition, the local heat transfer velocity was measured using the controlled flux technique. To the best of our knowledge these are the first measurements of the instantaneous 2-D velocity fields generated beneath microscale breaking waves. Careful measurements of the water surface profile enabled us to make accurate estimates of the near-surface velocities using PIV. Previous experiments have shown that behind the leading edge of a microscale breaker the cool skin layer is disrupted creating a thermal signature in the IR image [Jessup et al., J. Geophys. Res. 102, 23145 (1997)]. The simultaneously sampled IR images and PIV data enabled us to show that these disruptions or wakes are typically produced by a series of vortices that form behind the leading edge of the breaker. When the vortices are first formed they are very strong and coherent but as time passes, and they move from the crest region to the back face of the wave, they become weaker and less coherent. The near-surface vorticity was correlated with both the fractional area coverage of microscale breaking waves and the local heat transfer velocity. The strong correlations provide convincing evidence that the wakes produced by microscale breaking waves are regions of high near-surface vorticity that are in turn responsible for enhancing air–water heat transfer rates.},

Some tentative remarks are offered about the problem when dissipation is allowed.

The model improves and extends a recent quasi-steady theory of Craik \& Leibovich which asserts that the Langmuir circulations arise from a nonlinear interaction between surface waves and the frictional wind drift current. In turn, the development of the wind drift should be strongly influenced by Langmuir circulations, when they are present, and the two current systems are therefore treated here as a single inseparable system driven by a prescribed wind stress and surface wave field. Mixing by the vertical motions in the Langmuir circulations is shown to yield solutions for the wind drift, obtained both analytically and numerically, which are consistent with experiments and with field observations. The model yields a streaky flow pattern with a mean motion much like a turbulent wall layer, although the model is deterministic. In particular, it is found that a ‘viscous sublayer’ joins surface water to a logarithmic ‘inertial sublayer’ below. The scaling rules that emerge from the theory allow the surface speed of the wind drift to reach nearly full development in a matter of minutes.},

            A comprehensive in situ data set was obtained for the purpose of testing upper ocean turbulence models. The data set was collected in 38 m deep water over the North Carolina shelf. Available time series of surface meteorological forcing, including waves, winds, and heat fluxes, as well as underwater profiles of temperature, salinity, and horizontal velocity, were found suitable for constraining and testing numerical models in realistic environmental scenarios of the coastal ocean. The Navy Coastal Ocean Model was tested in a vertical 1‐D mode with a suite of previously incorporated subgrid turbulence closure models. Modeled output of turbulent quantities, such as the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate, were evaluated against comparable turbulence observations from a bottom mounted acoustic velocity profiler and a glider mounted turbulent shear probe. The results demonstrate a steady incremental skill increase among available turbulence closure models over several decades of their development, however the correlation with observed turbulence remains weak. The analysis of remaining model errors identified a need to add wave‐dependence to the air‐sea momentum flux formulation to account for waves that are out of balance or misaligned with the wind.

            Plain Language Summary 
            Ocean circulation contains an interconnected cascade of fluid motions with lengthscales ranging from the basin scales (∼1,000 km), down to the smallest dissipative scales (∼10 mm). Resolving all these motions is prohibitively computationally expensive for a numerical ocean circulation model, even on the world's fastest supercomputers. Therefore, the model grid usually covers the basin with spacing only down to ∼1 km. Smaller scale turbulent processes are averaged within each grid cell and are parameterized and solved for by means of a simplified subgrid turbulence model. This study takes on the challenge of testing such subgrid model against real ocean observations. The turbulent quantities computed by the model, such as the amount of small‐scale turbulent kinetic energy and the rate of its dissipation, were evaluated against similar quantities observed at sea. The results demonstrate a steady improvement in model performance from earlier versions a few decades ago, to the modern version. However, a recommendation is made to modify the formulation of air‐sea boundary condition to achieve further improvements in the model performance. In summary, this study confirms the usefulness of subgrid models to simplify ocean modeling, and offers a direction and an empirical testbed for further development.

	abstract = {Using observations from the Martha’s Vineyard Coastal Observatory, this paper investigates how momentum flux in the marine atmospheric surface layer over the coastal ocean varies with fetch, wave age and wave slope, and assesses the performance of the COARE 3.5 bulk parameterization. Long-fetch (at least 300 km) and short-fetch (3-6 km away from land) conditions have very similar momentum flux, with the latter being just 15\% higher. The COARE 3.5 wind-speed dependent formulation closely matches the observations. The sea state dependence of wave age and wave slope is analyzed by considering both peak frequency and mean frequency in a wave spectrum. The slope of regression lines between normalized roughness and wave age is sensitive to wind speed ranges and the scatter of momentum flux, potentially explaining why earlier studies did not find an universal formula to characterize the wave dependence. Although the observed momentum flux exhibits an obvious dependence on wave age, a robust quadratic fit between momentum flux and the 10-m neutral wind speed exists only for young waves. For the short-fetch conditions, the momentum flux does not increase as wave slope increases. This may be because waves generated by local wind are still weak and swell that propagates from other areas dominate wave spectra. In other words, wave slope computed by considering the spectra does not properly reflect the local wind-wave interaction.},

Three-dimensional wave number frequency spectra of gravity-capillary waves were measured using a scanning laser slope gauge (SLSG). When wind is started rapidly, gravity-capillary waves of a particular wave number (initial wavelets) first appear, and they are immediately followed by waves over a wider wave number range (both in magnitude and in direction). These waves all appear to grow exponentially, with each wave number growing at its own growth rate. The observed energy input rates from wind to waves are always maximum for along-wind waves and are smaller for waves in directions oblique to the wind. When wind speed is modulated periodically in time, the modulation of the wind stress lags behind that of the wind speed, and the short wind wave spectra lag further behind the wind stress. Assuming that waves are modulated according to existing relaxation theory and that the relaxation rate is identical to the wave growth rate, very short wind waves appear to respond to the instantaneous wind speed while longer wind waves appear to respond to the instantaneous wind stress.},

Our method is applicable to dielectric objects exhibiting diffuse and specular reflectance, though lighting and albedo must be known. We relax this requirement by showing that either spatially varying albedo or illumination can be estimated from the polarisation image alone using nonlinear methods. In the case of illumination, the estimate can only be made up to a binary ambiguity which we show is a generalised Bas-relief transformation corresponding to the convex/concave ambiguity. We believe that our method is the first passive, monocular shape-from-x technique that enables well-posed height estimation with only a single, uncalibrated illumination condition.

The results indicate that refraction is the main factor in modulating wave height and overall wave energy. Although the structure of the current field varies considerably, some current-induced patterns in the wave spectrum are observed. In high frequencies, the energy cascading generated by nonlinear interactions is suppressed, and the development of a spectral tail is disturbed, as a consequence of the detuning of the four-wave resonance conditions. Furthermore, the presence of currents slows the downshifting of the spectral peak. The suppression of the high-frequency energy under the influence of currents is more prominent as the spectral steepness increases. The energy suppression is also more accentuated and long-standing along the fetch when the directional spreading of waves is sufficiently broad. This result indicates that the current-induced detuning of resonant conditions is more effective when exact resonances are the primary mechanism of nonlinear interactions than when quasi resonances prevail (directionally narrow cases). Additionally, the directional analysis shows that the highly variable currents broaden the directional spreading of waves. The broadening is suggested to be related to random refraction and scattering of wave rays. The random disturbance of wavenumbers alters the nonlinear interaction conditions and weakens the energy exchanges among wave components, which is expressed in the suppression of the high-frequency energy.},

The data were analyzed to explore the influence of swell on the drag coefficient. It was found that when compared to periods of equal wind speed, the drag coefficient was reduced up to 37 \% when swell energy was twice that of the wind sea energy.

This implies that both oceanic currents and surface wind-induced drift must be taken into account for the successful forecasting of the trajectories and landfall of oil particles, even in energetic environments such as the Gulf of Mexico.

By quickly scanning the laser beam, the spatial and temporal evolution of the surface undulation can be studied in great detail. The spatial measurement of the surface fluctuation also allows direct computation of the wavenumber spectra in the capillary-gravity wave regime. This approach avoids the difficulty of resolving the Doppler frequency shift encountered in the processing of high-frequency spectra derived from a single-point sensor. The modulation of short waves by the orbital velocity of surface long waves is analyzed from the distribution of the wavenumber spectra of short waves along the phase of long waves. Key parameters determining the modulation magnitude are identified to be the slope of wavenumber spectra in the neighborhood of the modulated wave component, the ratio of the group and phase velocities of the modulated wave component, the dimensionless relaxation parameter, and the resonance parameter. Quantitative results on these parameters are obtained from the experimental data},

	abstract = {In this paper we use results of microwave backscattering experiments over the past decade to attempt to present a coherent picture of the ocean wave‐radar modulation transfer function (MTF) based on composite surface theory, short‐wave modulation, and modulated wind stress. A simplified relaxation model is proposed for the modulation of the gravity‐capillary wavenumber spectrum by long waves. The model is based on the relaxation rate and the equilibrium gravity‐capillary wavenumber spectrum. It differs from previous models by including all airflow modulation effects in the response of the equilibrium spectrum to changes in the airflow. Thus the explicit modulation of individual source functions such as wind input, short‐wave dissipation, and nonlinear interactions need not be known in order to calculate the hydrodynainic MTF. By combining this new model of the hydrodynamic MTF with microwave measurements, we attempt to determine wind shear stress modulation caused by the long waves. In order to extract the hydrodynamic MTF from the microwave data, we remove tilt and range change effects from the measured MTFs using the published analytical forms for these effects. Our results show that the inferred hydrodynamic MTF is higher for II polarization scattering than for V polarization. Since this is impossible if we have obtained the true hydrodynamic MTF, these results strongly indicate a problem with composite scattering theory as it has been traditionally applied. One explanation for this result may be the effects of intermediate‐scale waves suggested by Romeiser et al. (1993). Since these effects are much stronger for H polarization than for V polarization, they may explain our observed discrepancy and, if so, imply that V polarization return should yield an acceptable upper limit for the true hydrodynamic MTF. Thus we incorporate our V polarization results into the proposed model to estimate an upper limit for the wind shear stress modulation along the long‐wave profile. We infer that the primary source of modulation of Bragg resonant waves depends strongly on Bragg wavenumber and windspeed. For low values of these quantities, straining by long‐wave orbital velocities dominates the modulation process, while for higher values modulated wind stress becomes increasingly important. Our calculations indicate that wind stress modulation dominates the process for 3 cm Bragg waves at moderate to high wind speeds.},

	abstract = {The inherent optical properties (IOPs) of Polar Waters (PW) exiting the Arctic Ocean in the East Greenland Current (EGC) and of the inflowing Atlantic waters (AW) in the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) were studied in late summer when surface freshening due to sea-ice melt was widespread. The absorption and attenuation coefficients in PW were significantly higher than previous observations from the western Arctic. High concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) resulted in 50-60\% more heat deposition in the upper meters relative to clearest natural waters. This demonstrates the influence of terrigenous organic material inputs on the optical properties of waters in the Eurasian basin. Sea-ice melt in CDOM-rich PW decreased CDOM absorption, but an increase in scattering nearly compensated for lower absorption, and total attenuation was nearly identical in the sea-ice meltwater layer. This suggests a source of scattering material associated with sea-ice melt, relative to the PW. In the AW, melting sea-ice forms a stratified surface layer with lower absorption and attenuation, than well-mixed AW waters in late summer. It is likely that phytoplankton in the surface layer influenced by sea-ice melt are nutrient limited. The presence of a more transparent surface layer changes the vertical radiant heat absorption profile to greater depths in late summer both in EGC and WSC waters, shifting accumulation of solar heat to greater depths and thus this heat is not directly available for ice melt during periods of stratification.},

              This work serves as an observation‐based exploration into the role of wave‐driven turbulence at the air‐sea interface by measuring Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) dissipation rates above and below the sea surface. Subsurface ocean measurements confirm a TKE dissipation rate enhancement relative to the predicted law‐of‐the‐wall (

              ), which appears to be fully supported by wave breaking highlighting the role of the transport terms in balancing the subsurface TKE budget. Simultaneous measurements of TKE dissipation rates on the atmospheric side capture a deficit relative to the law‐of‐the‐wall (

              ). This deficit is explained in terms of wave‐induced perturbations, with observed convergence to the law‐of‐the‐wall at 14 m above mean sea level. The deficit on the atmospheric side provides an estimate of the energy flux divergence in the wave boundary layer. An exponential function is used to integrate in the vertical and provide novel estimates of the amount of energy going into the wave field. These estimates correlate well with classic spectral input parameterizations and can be used to derive an effective wave‐scale, capturing wind‐wave coupling purely from atmospheric observations intimately tied to wave‐induced perturbations of the air‐flow.

            Plain Language Summary 
            A long‐term field campaign on the Western North Atlantic shelf provided observations of Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) dissipation rates on both sides of the sea surface. These observations were used to track the energy exchange between the atmosphere and ocean that is mediated by surface waves. Deviations from the expected law‐of‐the‐wall scaling in our TKE dissipation rate estimates were linked to wind energy input leading to wave growth, wave breaking and the subsequent TKE injection into the water column. Observations confirm the subsurface enhancement of TKE relative to the classic law‐of‐the‐wall and showcase a TKE deficit on the atmospheric side. Atmospheric and oceanic TKE dissipation rates converge to the expected law‐of‐the‐wall profiles away from the surface but clearly show the importance of waves in atmosphere‐ocean interaction closer to the sea surface. Deviations from the law‐of‐the‐wall are presented as signature of wave‐induced turbulence close to the ocean surface.

The Lagrangian quality is also useful to prefilter wave orbital motions and mean currents from the velocity measurements, which are limited in magnitude by phase wrapping in the coherent Doppler processing.

If one adopts the wavenumber form as universal, it can then be shown that for shallow water S(ω)∝ω−3, a relation supported by observations. It is noted that deviations from the S(ω)∝ω−5 relation can be introduced not only by finite depth but also by permanent currents, as well as by the presence of long-wave components in the sea wave spectrum. In the latter case determination of S(ω) has to include both the Doppler effect, due to orbital displacements of liquid particles in long waves, as well as the effect of additional vertical acceleration in short waves propagating along the surface of the long-wave field.

	abstract = {We present an investigation of the azimuthal bimodality of the wind-wave spectrum for waves shorter than the dominant scale comparing numerical model solutions of developing waves from idealized experiments using WAVEWATCH III (WW3). The wave solutions were forced with the “exact” Webb–Resio–Tracy (WRT) nonlinear energy fluxes and the direct interaction approximation (DIA) with three different combinations of wind input and breaking dissipation parameterizations. The WRT gives larger azimuthal bimodal amplitudes compared to the DIA regardless of wind input/dissipation. The widely used wind input/dissipation parameterizations (i.e., ST4 and ST6) generally give narrow directional distributions with relatively small bimodal amplitudes and lobe separations compared to field measurements. These biases are significantly improved by the breaking dissipation of Romero (R2019). Moreover, the ratio of the resolved cross- to downwind mean square slope is significantly lower for ST4 and ST6 compared to R2019. The overlap integral relevant for the prediction of microseisms is several orders of magnitude smaller for ST4 and ST6 compared to R2019, which nearly agrees with a semiempirical model. Significance Statement Spectral gravity wave models generally cannot accurately predict the directional distribution which impacts their ability to predict the resolved down- and crosswind mean square slopes and the generation of microseisms. Our analysis shows that a directionally narrow spectral energy dissipation, accounting for long-wave–short-wave modulation, can significantly improve the directional distribution of the wind-wave spectrum by coupling to the nonlinear energy fluxes due to wave–wave interactions, which has important implications for improved predictions of the mean square slopes and the generation of microseisms.},

Wave steepness is an internal parameter denoting wave stability and is directly related to z$_{\textrm{0}}$. Wave age is an external parameter representing the ability of wind to input energy into waves. In low and moderate winds, wave steepness increases monotonically with decreasing wave age, which is equivalent to the growth relationships of wind waves. In high winds, wave steepness reaches a maximum due to intense wave breaking and remains as a constant, whereas wave age continues to decrease with increasing wind speed. The dimensionless roughness z$_{\textrm{0}}$/H$_{\textrm{s}}$ as a function of wave steepness is more suitable than wave age, because wave height is related to wave age through the growth relationships of wind waves. In low and moderate winds, wave steepness can be replaced by wave age; C$_{\textrm{D}}$ increases with the wind speed, with a weak dependence on wave state. In high winds, intense wave breaking results in the collapse of the relationship between wave steepness and wave age, and C$_{\textrm{D}}$ decreases significantly with decreasing wave age and levels off with wind speed. Further, the reduction of C$_{\textrm{D}}$ in high winds is a matter of fact if both their data are available.},

No obvious trend was found in the wave steepness dependence of sea surface roughness, but a wave steepness threshold behavior was readily identified in the wave age dependence of sea surface roughness. The influence of dominant wind waves on the surface roughness was illustrated using a wind–wave coupling model. The wave steepness threshold behavior is assumed to be related to the onset of dominant wave breaking. The important role of the interaction between swell and wind wave was highlighted, as swell can absorb energy from locally generated wind wave, which subsequently reduces the wave steepness and the probability of dominant wave breaking.},

By coupling these modifications into the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6), we conducted six sensitivity experiments to assess their direct impact on air–sea momentum flux under light wind conditions and their indirect impact on the simulation performance in low-latitude sea areas. During the iteration process in model, the complex negative feedback between wind speed and momentum flux led to differences in momentum flux patterns among experiments in the three key sea areas and inconsistency between offline and online test results. Based on the comprehensive evaluation metric Distance between Indices of Simulation and Observation (DISO), we assessed the simulation performance of experiments in the entire low-latitude sea area, the three key sea areas, and under light wind conditions. The discrepancy in the 10-m wind speeds deviation between light wind conditions and medium to strong wind conditions led to a reversal in the ranking of the simulation performance of the six experiments under light wind conditions compared to the entire low-latitude sea area.},

The use of vector-averaged, instead of scalar-averaged, wind speeds and the presence of waves only partially explain the increase in \$\$C\_\{D\}\$\$under light winds.

The instantaneous velocity fields above the waves were obtained by using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The velocity fields were decomposed into the mean, wave-induced and turbulent velocity components. The tested wind waves were primarily dissipated by capillaries and microscale breaking waves. The Bond number and the shear velocity-fetch based Reynolds number were found to correlate with the wind wave regimes well. The turbulent dissipation rates above the water surface were determined based on resolved spatial gradient of instantaneous velocities, where the time-averaged dissipation rate values were calibrated using those estimated from the one-dimensional velocity spectrum in the temporal space. Subsequently, the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget including its production, dissipation, advection and turbulent transport was presented. In addition, conditional averaging analysis of the TKE budgets over leeward, windward sides and all phases was performed. The results showed a strong dependency with the wave phase in the TKE budget terms except for the dissipation. The production-dissipation ratio increased significantly as the wind speed increased, likely attributed to the increased roughness over the substantial coverage of micro-breaking waves.},

	abstract = {The importance of wind energy as an alternative energy source has increased over the latest years with more focus on offshore winds. A good estimation of the offshore winds is thus of major importance for this industry. Up to now the effect of the wind–wave (mis)alignment has not yet been taken into account in coupled atmosphere–wave models to study the vertical wind profile and power production estimations of offshore wind farms. In this study the roughness length parametrization of Drennan et al. in 2003, and its extension addressing the wind–wave (mis)alignment proposed by Porchetta et al. in 2019, are investigated in the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere–Wave–Sediment Transport (COAWST) model. This study shows that the yearly mean wind estimation at hub height (100 m) is improved by the roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. compared to Drennan. This is mainly due to the increased roughness of the former parametrization compare to the latter, even in aligned wind–wave conditions. This difference in roughness is caused by the dataset used to obtain the constants, deep-water conditions versus mixed offshore conditions. Moreover, the roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. performs better in two of three alignment categories. Furthermore, similar model performances are obtained if we exclude the wind directions from the wind shadow zone of the measurement mast or the wind directions from the recently built Alpha Ventus wind farm, which is in close vicinity of the measurement mast. Investigating different wind conditions shows that the new roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. performs best for both offshore and onshore winds. Additionally, we show that the coupled model estimations of the vertical wind are only slightly affected by significant wave height estimations. Similar model performances for different accuracies of significant wave height estimations are presented. One exception is the perpendicular alignment category where the new roughness length of Porchetta et al. outperforms the roughness length of Drennan when investigating the wind estimations related to significant wave heights with a higher accuracy. The roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. reduced the power production overestimation of the coupled model from 5.7 to 2.8\%. We also show that the standalone atmospheric model including the roughness length of Charnock in 1955 has a degraded performance compared to the coupled model including the roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. for yearly average wind profiles.},

	abstract = {A better understanding of the wind–wave direction effect on the wind field and on the momentum transfer at the air–sea interaction will aid in the development of numerical atmospheric and wave models, important for wind energy studies among other applications. So far, the effect of opposed wind–wave directions on the wind field is not fully understood, even though it is shown to be an occurring phenomenon at the air–sea interface. To investigate the effects of different wind–wave alignments on the wind field and on the momentum transfer, the Wind Gallery of the von Karman Institute (VKI) was modified in order to perform aligned and opposed wind–wave direction experiments. The measurements performed to define the wind field and momentum transfer consisted of a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) setup with one laser and one camera. Based on this setup, differences in horizontal and vertical wave perturbation velocity as well as in phase-averaged wave-perturbation stress or momentum were observed between aligned and opposed wind–wave directions in terms of location, structure and vertical depth. This study thus provides support that the wind field and phase-averaged wave-perturbation momentum are dependent on the wind–wave alignment, which in the future should be accounted for in numerical models.},

	abstract = {Two-way feedback occurs between offshore wind and waves. However, the influence of the waves on the wind profile remains understudied, in particular the momentum transfer between the sea surface and the atmosphere. Previous studies showed that for swell waves it is possible to have increasing wind speeds in case of aligned wind–wave directions. However, the opposite is valid for opposed wind–wave directions, where a decrease in wind velocity is observed. Up to now, this behavior has not been included in most numerical models due to the lack of an appropriate parameterization of the resulting effective roughness length. Using an extensive data set of offshore measurements in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, we show that the wave roughness length affecting the wind is indeed dependent on the alignment between the wind and wave directions. Moreover, we propose a new roughness length parameterization, taking into account the dependence on alignment, consisting of an enhanced roughness length for increasing misalignment. Using this new roughness length parameterization in numerical models might facilitate a better representation of offshore wind, which is relevant to many applications including offshore wind energy and climate modeling.},

Many studies have been focused on the investigation of the dependence of drag coefficient on sea states that are usually denoted by wave age. However, no universally accepted relationship has been obtained up to now and the results are significantly scattered or even contradicted. We reviewed the parameterizations of sea-surface roughness as a function of wave age, and found that the phase speed at spectral peak cp is an important parameter to characterize the drag coefficient. For the same wave age, drag coefficient increases with increasing cp. Contrary to the traditional concept, the older waves with greater cp possesses higher sea-surface roughness for the same wind speed because more wave components participate the air–sea interaction and intensify the wind stress. With the buoy meansurements and the theory of equilibrium range of wind waves, we estimated fricition velocity and proposed that the frequency bandwidth and spectral width of the wave spectrum are more suitable parameters than the traditional wind speed and wave age to be used to parameterize drag coefficient. This study provides a new way to estimate wind stress through the reliable spectra of ocean waves.},

	abstract = {The concept of an “equivalent surface roughness” over the ocean is useful in understanding the relation between wind speed (at some height) and the net momentum flux from air to sea. The relative performance of different physics-motivated scalings for this roughness can provide valuable guidance as to which mechanisms are important under various conditions. Recently, two quite different roughness length scalings have been proposed. Taylor and Yelland presented a simple formula based on wave steepness, defined as the ratio of significant wave height to peak wavelength, to predict the surface roughness. A consequence of this formula is that roughness changes due to fetch or duration limitations are small, an order of 10\%. The wave steepness formula was proposed as an alternative to the classical wave-age scaling first suggested by Kitaigorodskii and Volkov. Wave-age scaling, in contrast to steepness scaling, predicts order-of-magnitude changes in roughness associated with fetch or duration. The existence of two scalings, with different roughness predictions in certain conditions, has led to considerable confusion among certain groups. At several recent meetings, including the 2001 World Climate Research Program/Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (WCRP/SCOR) workshop on the intercomparison and validation of ocean–atmosphere flux fields, proponents of the two scalings met with the goal of understanding the merits and limitations of each scaling. Here the results of these efforts are presented. The two sea-state scalings are tested using a composite of eight datasets representing a wide range of conditions. In conditions with a dominant wind-sea component, both scalings were found to yield improved estimates when compared with a standard bulk formulation. In general mixed sea conditions, the steepness formulation was preferred over both bulk and wave-age scalings, while for underdeveloped “young” wind sea, the wave-age formulation yields the best results. Neither sea-state model was seen to perform well in swell-dominated conditions where the steepness was small, but the steepness model did better than the wave-age model for swell-dominated conditions where the steepness exceeded a certain threshold.},

The model differs from others in that the physical premises are applicable to low wind speeds (10-m wind speed, U10 {\textless} 5 m s−1) as well as higher wind speeds. Another new feature of the model is an anisotropic roughness length, which allows a crosswind component of the stress to be modeled. The influence of the angle between the mean wind direction and the mean direction of wave propagation is included in the anisotropic roughness length. Most models are not accurate at low wind speeds and tend to underestimate fluxes in low wind speed regions such as the tropical oceans. Improvements over previous models are incorporated in the momentum roughness length parameterization. In addition, the dimensionless constant in the relationship between the capillary wave component of momentum roughness length and friction velocity is reevaluated using both wave tank data and field data. The new value is found to be 0.06, a factor of 3 smaller than the original estimate of 0.18. Modeling the influence of capillary waves is shown to improve the accuracy of modeled surface fluxes and drag coefficients. Several sets of tropical observations are used to examine mean increases in modeled fluxes due to capillary waves. The changes in latent heat fluxes are compared to proposed increases due to convective overturning (sometimes called gustiness) and are found to be larger by a factor of 4. For U10 {\textless} 7 m s−1, the mean estimates for tropical fluxes of momentum and latent heat are found to increase by 0.004 N m−2 and 6 W m−2.},

            At times, high-resolution images of sea surface roughness can provide stunning details of submesoscale upper-ocean dynamics. As interpreted, transformations of short-scale wind waves by horizontal current gradients are responsible for those spectacular observations. Those observations could prove particularly useful to validate numerical ocean models that reach increasingly high resolutions. Focusing on surface roughness at optical wavelengths, two steps have recently been performed in that direction. First, it was shown in a previous paper by Rascle et al. that surface roughness variations not only trace surface current divergence but also other characteristics of the current gradient tensor, mainly the strain in the wind direction. The wind direction with respect to the current gradient thus stands out as an important interpretative parameter. The second step is the purpose of the present paper, where the effect of the viewing direction is investigated. To this end, the authors discuss pairs of quasi-simultaneous sun-glitter images, taken from different satellite positions, to provide different viewing configurations, namely, quasi-orthogonal azimuth angles at similar zenith angles. As evidenced, upwind and crosswind viewing observations can be markedly different. As further confirmed with idealized numerical simulations, this anisotropy well traces anisotropic surface current areas, while more isotropic contrasts likely trace areas dominated by surface divergence conditions. These findings suggest the potential to directly separate divergence from other deformations by using high-resolution roughness observations at multiple azimuth view angles.},

              Laboratory measurements of the interaction between high‐frequency (HF) wind‐waves and low frequency (LF) paddle waves are presented. The measurements were made in a wind‐wave flume with wind and paddle waves propagating in the same direction. The primary objective is to examine the physical mechanisms proposed to explain the suppression of wind‐waves due to presence of swell (here paddle waves). For this purpose, the precise time scale of the temporal transition from wind‐only to wind‐plus‐paddle conditions is examined. The results reveal that the majority of wind‐wave suppression occurs too quickly to have been caused by reduced wind‐input, instead indicating that enhanced HF wave dissipation is the primary suppression mechanism. The spatial variation in HF wave energy along the LF wave phase indicates that HF suppression mainly occurs on the LF wave crest, and high on the windward face, which are the locations that experience the highest wind velocities. This observation also suggests that the reduced wind‐input is not the primary suppression mechanism. Quantification of HF wave suppression versus a broad range of wind velocities, paddle wave conditions and fetch did not reveal any critical dependence of suppression on LF wave breaking or wind separation at LF wave crests. It is concluded that suppression occurs primarily due to enhanced dissipation of HF waves near LF wave crests. This mechanism is proposed to be coupled to the wind velocity, where an increased wind velocity near LF wave crests exceeds the level of forcing that HF waves of low

            Plain Language Summary 
            Wind action on water surface results in generation and growth of wind‐waves. Observations have shown that the presence of swell traveling in the wind direction suppresses the wind‐waves. There is however no consensus on the physical mechanisms behind this effect. In this study, the proposed mechanisms are examined through laboratory observations of the interaction between wind‐waves and paddle waves. This includes observations of the precise transition time scale as paddle waves enter an existing wind‐wave field. The rapidity of suppression indicates that wind‐waves are actively erased by paddle waves, more so than being inhibited in their growth which is a slower process. The measurements also reveal that suppression of wind‐waves mainly occurs near the crest of paddle waves, and high on their windward face, which are the locations most exposed to the wind. Both observations indicate that enhanced dissipation of wind‐waves is the primary mechanism of their suppression, while the reduction of wind energy input to wind‐waves only plays a secondary role. The enhanced dissipation of wind‐waves is suggested to be linked to the wind velocity, with wind‐waves breaking at the crest of paddle waves as the excess wind velocity at this location exceeds the threshold the wind‐waves can withstand.

We develop a traveling wave generator using a rubber sheet and piezoelectric actuator as a vibration source. A single piezoelectric actuator is installed in the upstream position of the channel. Experiments are performed using traveling waves attenuating in the downstream direction. With traveling wave control, effective drag reduction is confirmed when bulk Reynolds number is within the range of 2000 \&lt; Reb \&lt; 6000. For Reb = 3000, the maximum drag reduction rate of 10\% is obtained. In order to evaluate a relationship between the amplitude attenuation of traveling wave and drag reduction effect, particle image velocimetry (PIV) at multiple positions is performed. Increase of drag is observed near the vibration source whereas drag decreased at other positions. Reduction of random component of Reynolds shear stress can be ascribed to the drag reduction.},

	abstract = {The wind-driven stably stratified mid-latitude oceanic surface turbulent boundary layer is computationally simulated in the presence of a specified surface gravity-wave field. The gravity waves have broad wavenumber and frequency spectra typical of measured conditions in near-equilibrium with the mean wind speed. The simulation model is based on (i) an asymptotic theory for the conservative dynamical effects of waves on the wave-averaged boundary-layer currents and (ii) a boundary-layer forcing by a stochastic representation of the impulses and energy fluxes in a field of breaking waves. The wave influences are shown to be profound on both the mean current profile and turbulent statistics compared to a simulation without these wave influences and forced by an equivalent mean surface stress. As expected from previous studies with partial combinations of these wave influences, Langmuir circulations due to the wave-averaged vortex force make vertical eddy fluxes of momentum and material concentration much more efficient and non-local (i.e. with negative eddy viscosity near the surface), and they combine with the breakers to increase the turbulent energy and dissipation rate. They also combine in an unexpected positive feedback in which breaker-generated vorticity seeds the creation of a new Langmuir circulation and instigates a deep strong intermittent downwelling jet that penetrates through the boundary layer and increases the material entrainment rate at the base of the layer. These wave effects on the boundary layer are greater for smaller wave ages and higher mean wind speeds.},

Results from the experiments show that the vortex force generates Langmuir circulations that can dominate vertical mixing. The simulated vertical velocity fields show linear, small‐scale, coherent structures near the surface that extend downwind across the model domain. In the interior of the mixed layer, scales of motion increase to eddy sizes that are roughly equivalent to the mixed‐layer depth. Cases with the vortex force have stronger circulations near the surface in contrast to cases with only heat flux and wind stress, particularly when the heat flux is positive. Calculations of the velocity variance and turbulence dissipation rates for cases with and without the vortex force, surface cooling, and wind stress indicate that wave‐current interactions are a dominant mixing process in the upper mixed layer. Heat flux calculations show that the entrainment rate at the mixed‐layer base can be up to two times greater when the vortex force is included. In a case with reduced wind stress, turbulence dissipation rates remained high near the surface because of the vortex force interaction with preexisting inertial currents. In deep mixed layers (∼250 m) the simulations show that Langmuir circulations can vertically transport water 145 m during conditions of surface heating. Observations of turbulence dissipation rates and the vertical temperature structure support the model results.},

            Large-eddy simulations are made for the canonical Ekman layer problem of a steady wind above a uniformly rotating, constant-density ocean. The focus is on the influence of surface gravity waves: namely, the wave-averaged Stokes-Coriolis and Stokes-vortex forces and parameterized wave breaking for momentum and energy injection. The wave effects are substantial: the boundary layer is deeper, the turbulence is stronger, and eddy momentum flux is dominated by breakers and Langmuir circulations with a vertical structure inconsistent with both the conventional logarithmic layer and eddy viscosity relations. The surface particle mean drift is dominated by Stokes velocity with Langmuir circulations playing a minor role. Implications are assessed for parameterization of the mean velocity profile in the Ekman layer with wave effects by exploring several parameterization ideas. The authors find that the K-profile parameterization (KPP) eddy viscosity is skillful for the interior of the Ekman layer with wave-enhanced magnitude and depth scales. Furthermore, this parameterization form is also apt in the breaker and Stokes layers near the surface when it is expressed as a Lagrangian eddy viscosity (i.e., turbulent Reynolds stress proportional to vertical shear of the Lagrangian mean flow, inclusive of Stokes drift) with a derived eddy-viscosity shape and with a diagnosed vertical profile of a misalignment angle between Reynolds stress and Lagrangian mean shear.},

            A prior second-moment closure (SMC) model of Langmuir turbulence in the upper ocean is modified by introduction of inhomogeneous pressure–strain rate and pressure–scalar gradient closures that are similar to the high Reynolds number, near-wall treatments for solid wall boundaries. This repairs several near-surface defects in the algebraic Reynolds stress model (ARSM) of the prior SMC by redirecting Craik–Leibovich (CL) vortex force production of turbulent kinetic energy out of the surface-normal vertical component and into a horizontal one, with an associated reduction in near-surface CL production of vertical momentum flux. A surface-proximity function introduces a new closure parameter that is tuned to previous results from large-eddy simulations (LES), and a numerical SMC model based on stability functions from the new ARSM produces improved comparisons with mean profiles of momentum and TKE components from steady-state LES results forced by aligned wind and waves. An examination of higher-order quasi-homogeneous closures and a numerical simulation of Langmuir turbulence away from the boundaries both show the near-surface inhomogeneous closure to be both necessary for consistency and preferable for simplicity.},

Misalignments from 0° to 135° are examined and Langmuir turbulence structures are evident in all cases. The Stokes drift is modeled using a broadband empirical spectrum, and cases with and without the Coriolis effect, wind waves, and an initial mixed layer are examined. The expected scaling for the vertical velocity variance is recovered in the aligned simulations and is adapted here to the misaligned cases. The adjusted scaling projects the friction velocity (aligned with the wind stress) into the dominant axial direction of the Langmuir cells. The turbulent Langmuir number is generalized through a similar projection into the axial direction of the Langmuir cells, which reduces its value in realistic conditions. For known Langmuir cell orientations, the strength of Langmuir turbulence for misaligned cases can be estimated using the projected Langmuir number. A prediction for the angle between the wind stress and cell direction is obtained using the law of the wall; this prediction only requires the wind stress, Stokes drift, and boundary layer depth. Conditional analyses show that, with increasing misalignment, the typically antisymmetric Langmuir cell pairs become asymmetric. This asymmetry is due, in part, to the advection by cross cell flow of vorticity from one vortex tube onto the other, and in part due to an asymmetry induced by the stretching of vertical vorticity into cross cell vorticity.

	abstract = {If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based. Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth 
              h 
              , where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at 
              h 
              . This nonlocal “ 
              K 
              profile parameterization” (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind‐driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double‐diffusion density ratio, 
              R 
              ρ 
              . Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969–1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long‐Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.},

	abstract = {New experiments have been carried out in a large laboratory channel to explore the structure of turbulent motion in the water layer beneath surface gravity waves. These experiments involve pure wind waves as well as wind-ruffled mechanically generated waves. A submersible two-component LDV system has been used to obtain the three components of the instantaneous velocity field along the vertical direction at a single fetch of 26 m. The displacement of the free surface has been determined simultaneously at the same downstream location by means of wave gauges. For both types of waves, suitable separation techniques have been used to split the total fluctuating motion into an orbital contribution (i.e. a motion induced by the displacement of the surface) and a turbulent contribution. Based on these experimental results, the present paper focuses on the structure of the water turbulence. The most prominent feature revealed by the two sets of experiments is the enhancement of both the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate with respect to values found near solid walls. Spectral analysis provides clear indications that wave–turbulence interactions greatly affect energy transfers over a significant frequency range by imposing a constant timescale related to the wave-induced strain. For mechanical waves we discuss several turbulent statistics and their modulation with respect to the wave phase, showing that the turbulence we observed was deeply affected at both large and small scales by the wave motion. An analysis of the phase variability of the bursting suggests that there is a direct interaction between the waves and the underlying turbulence, mainly at the wave crests. Turbulence budgets show that production essentially takes place in the wavy region of the flow, i.e. above the wave troughs. These results are finally used to address the nature of the basic mechanisms governing wave–turbulence interactions.},

The results show that the waves cause an increase in the number of wall ejections, giving rise to an increase in the measured values of the turbulence intensities and Reynolds stresses. However, the increases in ejection frequency do not appear to be directly related to wave frequency. They correlate better with wave amplitude. Conditional averaging of the velocity fields shows that while turbulence is increased in the region below the crest of the waves (extending to the wall), it is decreased in the wave troughs. The overall effect of the surface waves, over the range of conditions investigated is, however, to increase turbulence levels.},

When observed in the wave‐following frame, maxima of the fluctuating normal stresses occur near the wave crest; the fluctuating shear stress is positive and possesses a peak on the windward face of the mechanically‐generated wave.

	abstract = {A study is made of some numerical calculations of two-dimensional and geostrophic turbulent flows. The primary result is that, under a broad range of circumstances, the flow structure has its vorticity concentrated in a small fraction of the spatial domain, and these concentrations typically have lifetimes long compared with the characteristic time for nonlinear interactions in turbulent flow (i.e. an eddy turnaround time). When such vorticity concentrations occur, they tend to assume an axisymmetric shape and persist under passive advection by the large-scale flow, except for relatively rare encounters with other centres of concentration. These structures can arise from random initial conditions without vorticity concentration, evolving in the midst of what has been traditionally characterized as the ‘cascade’ of isotropic, homogeneous, large-Reynolds-number turbulence: the systematic elongation of isolines of vorticity associated with the transfer of vorticity to smaller scales, eventually to dissipation scales, and the transfer of energy to larger scales. When the vorticity concentrations are a sufficiently dominant component of the total vorticity field, the cascade processes are suppressed. The demonstration of persistent vorticity concentrations on intermediate scales - smaller than the scale of the peak of the energy spectrum and larger than the dissipation scales - does not invalidate many of the traditional characterizations of two-dimensional and geostrophic turbulence, but I believe it shows them to be substantially incomplete with respect to a fundamental phenomenon in such flows.},

            Coherent vortices within the aqueous shear layer beneath wind waves contribute to the interfacial scalar transfer and induce elongated high‐speed streaks on the interface. Analyses of thermal images from wind‐wave flume experiments reveal that the scaling between the mean streak spacing and the surface friction velocity is different from that of wall‐bounded flow. Comparative numerical simulations of shear flow bounded by flat and wavy surfaces are conducted to explain such a deviation. In the low‐wind range with insignificant surface waves, the difference is attributed to the insufficient boundary shear to maintain the turbulence. For the range of moderate wind speeds in which surface waves become pronounced but remain to be unbroken, surface waves enhance the formation of coherent vortices and reduce the streak spacings. For the high‐wind range in which the surface waves break, the mean streak spacing approximately follows the wall‐flow scaling.

            Two new five-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers—the Nortek Signature1000 AD2CP and the Teledyne RDI Sentinel V50—are demonstrated to measure turbulence at two energetic tidal channels within Puget Sound, Washington. The quality of the raw data is tested by analyzing the turbulent kinetic energy frequency spectra, the turbulence spatial structure function, the shear in the profiles, and the covariance Reynolds stresses. The five-beam configuration allows for a direct estimation of the Reynolds stresses from along-beam velocity fluctuations. The Nortek’s low Doppler noise and high sampling frequency allow for the observation of the turbulent inertial subrange in both the frequency spectra and the turbulence structure function. The turbulence parameters obtained from the five-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers are validated with turbulence data from simultaneous measurements with acoustic Doppler velocimeters. These combined results are then used to assess a turbulent kinetic energy budget in which depth profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and production rates are compared. The associated codes are publicly available on the MATLAB File Exchange website.},

	abstract = {A combination of turbulence-resolving large-eddy simulations and observations are used to examine the influence of swell amplitude and swell propagation angle on surface drag. Based on the analysis a new surface roughness parameterization with nonequilibrium wave effects is proposed. The surface roughness accounts for swell amplitude and wavelength and its relative motion with respect to the mean wind direction. The proposed parameterization is tested in uncoupled three-dimensional Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) simulations at grid sizes near 1 km where we explore potential implications of our modifications for two-way coupled atmosphere–wave models. Wind–wave misalignment likely explains the large scatter in observed nondimensional surface roughness under swell-dominated conditions. Andreas et al.’s relationship between friction velocity and the 10-m wind speed under predicts the increased drag produced by misaligned winds and waves. Incorporating wave-state (speed and direction) influences in parameterizations improves predictive skill. In a broad sense, these results suggest that one needs information on winds and wave state to upscale buoy measurements.},

	abstract = {Doppler-lidar scan techniques for wind profiling rely on the assumption of a horizontally homogeneous wind field and stationarity for the duration of the scan. As this condition is mostly violated in reality, detailed knowledge of the resulting measurement error is required. The objective of this study is to quantify and compare the expected error associated with Doppler-lidar wind profiling for different scan strategies and meteorological conditions by performing virtual Doppler-lidar measurements implemented in a large-eddy simulation (LES) model. Various factors influencing the lidar retrieval error are analyzed through comparison of the wind measured by the virtual lidar with the “true” value generated by the LES. These factors include averaging interval length, zenith angle configuration, scan technique and instrument orientation (cardinal direction). For the first time, ensemble simulations are used to determine the statistically expected uncertainty of the lidar error. The analysis reveals a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of less than 1 m s−1 for 10 min averages of wind speed measurements in a moderately convective boundary layer, while RMSD exceeds 2 m s−1 in strongly convective conditions. Unlike instrument orientation with respect to the main flow and scanning scheme, the zenith angle configuration proved to have significant effect on the retrieval error. Horizontal wind speed error is reduced when a larger zenith angle configuration is used but is increased for measurements of vertical wind. Furthermore, we find that extending the averaging interval length of lidar measurements reduces the error. In addition, a longer duration of a full scan cycle and hence a smaller number of scans per averaging interval increases the error. Results suggest that the scan strategy has a measurable impact on the lidar retrieval error and that instrument configuration should be chosen depending on the quantity of interest and the flow conditions in which the measurement is performed.},

The main contribution of this work is to update previous SWIFT methods to account for bias due to surface gravity waves, which are ubiquitous in the near-surface region. We present a technique where the data are prefiltered by removing profiles of wave orbital velocities obtained via empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the data prior to computing the structure function. Our analysis builds on previous work to remove wave bias in which analytic modifications are made to the structure function model. However, we find the analytic approach less able to resolve the strong vertical gradients in ϵ(z) near the surface. The strength of the EOF filtering technique is that it does not require any assumptions about the structure of nonturbulent shear, and does not add any additional degrees of freedom in the least squares fit to the model of the structure function. In comparison to the analytic method, ϵ(z) estimates obtained via empirical filtering have substantially reduced noise and a clearer dependence on near-surface wind speed.},

On the other hand, volumetric scans allow for the characterization of the spatial variability of the wind field with much lower temporal resolution than fixed scans. In this work, the recently developed “LiDAR Statistical Barnes Objective Analysis” (LiSBOA) algorithm for the optimal design of LiDAR scans and retrieval of wind velocity statistics is tailored for applications in the MABL. The LiDAR data, collected during a recent experimental campaign over Lake Lavon in Texas, show a good consistency of mean velocity profiles between fixed and LiSBOA-interpolated volumetric data, thus further encouraging the use of coupled fixed and volumetric scans for simultaneous characterizations of wind turbulence statistics along the vertical direction and volumetric heterogeneity of the wind field.},

	abstract = {The thermal signature of a low Reynolds number turbulent jet impacting a free surface was investigated experimentally. Three Reynolds numbers (1000, 3000, and 4800) were investigated for a configuration in which the jet nozzle diameter and the depth of the jet beneath the free surface were fixed. A high resolution infrared detector was used to collect thermal imagery of the surface temperature field. These data were then used to examine the detailed statistical nature of the resulting coupled thermal-hydrodynamic field. The analysis included an examination of the instantaneous, mean, and fluctuating surface thermal fields. Examination of the instantaneous fields strongly suggested the existence of a turbulent core region and a weaker outer region. The existence of this inner-outer structure associated with the surface flow was confirmed by a detailed examination of the mean surface temperature fields. In addition, the outer structure of the mean surface temperature appeared to correspond well with the existence of a surface current first observed by Anthony and Willmarth [“Turbulence measurements in a round jet beneath a free surface,” J. Fluid Mech. 243, 699 (1992)]. A self-similar region of the temperature field associated with the turbulent core was also clearly identified. Finally, the statistics of the surface thermal fluctuation fields were examined. These statistics revealed high thermal fluctuations near the edge of the flow field associated with flow intermittency there, as well as evidence of surface capillary waves which were generated as a result of the jet-surface interaction. In addition, the thermal fluctuation field was further examined using a Karhunen–Loeve analysis.},

The wind stress is mainly obtained by drag coefficient parameterizations, which always consider the wind stress to be aligned with the wind, but this is sometimes the case. Also, during moderate to weak wind conditions, these parameterizations may lead to high estimation errors due to the presence of swell. This study measured the wind stress with a high-rate (100 Hz) sonic anemometer mounted on a spar buoy. The sea state was also characterized by obtaining the directional spectrum of the waves by six wave-staff arrays sensing the free surface level at 10 Hz. Bouy’s movement was corrected by employing an inertial motion unit. The turbulent and wave-coherent wind stress components were also estimated and analyzed. It was observed that during swell conditions with wind traveling in the same direction, the wave-coherent wind stress component has an opposite direction to the wind and dampens the total wind stress magnitude. During counter-directional wind relative to swell events, the wave boundary layer is modified; swell produces a wave-coherent wind stress in the same direction as the wind, resulting in an enhanced total wind stress magnitude. The wave age, significant wave height, and the traveling direction of the swell relative to the wind are essential to correctly estimating the wind stress in swell-dominant conditions. A set of empirical parameterizations for each wind stress component is proposed.},

This suggests that wave-turbulence interaction is one mechanism that can lead to streak formation in breaking wave systems. More specifically, the streaky structures observed in these experiments may be caused by an intense, rapid tilting, and stretching of pre-existing vertical vorticity by the Stokes drift generated at or near the breaking wave crests, thereby generating a coherent system of counter-rotating vortices.

            Ocean surface processes, and air–sea interaction in general, have recently received increased attention because it is now accepted that small-scale surface phenomena can play a crucial role in the air–sea fluxes of heat, mass, and momentum, with important implications for weather and climate studies. Yet, despite good progress in recent years, the air–sea interface and the adjacent atmospheric and marine boundary layers have proven to be difficult to measure in all but the most benign conditions. This has led to the need for novel measurement techniques to quantify processes of air–sea interaction. Here the authors present infrared techniques aimed at simultaneously studying multiple aspects of the air–sea interface and air–sea fluxes. The instrumentation was tested and deployed during several field experiments from Research Platform (R/P) FLIP and Scripps pier. It is shown that these techniques permit the detailed study of the ocean surface temperature and velocity fields. In particular, it is shown that cross-correlation techniques typically used in particle image velocimetry can be used to infer the ocean surface velocity field from passive infrared temperature images. In addition, when conditions make cross-correlation techniques less effective, an active infrared marking and tracking technique [which will be called thermal marker velocimetry (TMV)] can be successfully used to measure the surface velocity and its spatial and temporal derivatives. The thermal marker velocimetry technique also provides estimates of the heat transfer velocity and surface renewal frequencies. Finally, infrared altimetry is used to complement the temperature and kinematic data obtained from passive imagery and active marking. The data obtained during the testing and deployment of this instrumentation provide a novel description of the kinematics of the surface of the ocean.},

	abstract = {A rapid-distortion model is developed to investigate the interaction of weak turbulence  
with a monochromatic irrotational surface water wave. The model is applicable when  
the orbital velocity of the wave is larger than the turbulence intensity, and when  
the slope of the wave is sufficiently high that the straining of the turbulence by the  
wave dominates over the straining of the turbulence by itself. The turbulence suffers  
two distortions. Firstly, vorticity in the turbulence is modulated by the wave orbital  
motions, which leads to the streamwise Reynolds stress attaining maxima at the wave  
crests and minima at the wave troughs; the Reynolds stress normal to the free surface  
develops minima at the wave crests and maxima at the troughs. Secondly, over several  
wave cycles the Stokes drift associated with the wave tilts vertical vorticity into the  
horizontal direction, subsequently stretching it into elongated streamwise vortices,  
which come to dominate the flow. These results are shown to be strikingly different  
from turbulence distorted by a mean shear flow, when ‘streaky structures’ of high and  
low streamwise velocity fluctuations develop. It is shown that, in the case of distortion  
by a mean shear flow, the tendency for the mean shear to produce streamwise vortices  
by distortion of the turbulent vorticity is largely cancelled by a distortion of the mean  
vorticity by the turbulent fluctuations. This latter process is absent in distortion by  
Stokes drift, since there is then no mean vorticity. 
            The components of the Reynolds stress and the integral length scales computed  
from turbulence distorted by Stokes drift show the same behaviour as in the simulations  
of Langmuir turbulence reported by McWilliams, Sullivan \& Moeng (1997).  
Hence we suggest that turbulent vorticity in the upper ocean, such as produced  
by breaking waves, may help to provide the initial seeds for Langmuir circulations,  
thereby complementing the shear-flow instability mechanism developed by Craik \&  
Leibovich (1976). 
            The tilting of the vertical vorticity into the horizontal by the Stokes drift tends  
also to produce a shear stress that does work against the mean straining associated  
with the wave orbital motions. The turbulent kinetic energy then increases at the  
expense of energy in the wave. Hence the wave decays. An expression for the wave  
attenuation rate is obtained by scaling the equation for the wave energy, and is found  
to be broadly consistent with available laboratory data.},

The growth, development, and breaking of short wind-driven surface waves are key mediators of the air–sea exchange of momentum, heat and trace gases. The mechanisms through which surfactants suppress waves have been studied in great detail through careful laboratory experimentation in quasi-one-dimensional wave tanks. However, the spatial scales over which this damping occurs in structurally complex surfactant slicks on the real ocean have not been resolved. Here, we present the results of field observations of the spatial response of decimetre- to millimetre-scale waves to biogenic surfactant slicks. We found that wave damping in organic material-rich coastal waters resulted in a net (spatio-temporally averaged) reduction of approximately 50\% in wave slope variance relative to the open ocean for low to moderate wind speeds. This reduction of wave slope variance is understood to result in a corresponding reduction in momentum input to the wave field. This significant effect had thus far evaded quantification due in large part to the enormous range of scales required for its description—spanning the sea surface microlayer to the ocean submesoscale.},

Its formation and breakup is intimately connected with large-scale climatic processes, local weather patterns, and the use of sea ice in coastal Arctic regions by Indigenous people. In order to investigate the physical phenomena at the heart of this process, a set of targeted, intensive observations were made over spring sea ice melt and breakup in Kotzebue Sound, Alaska. These observations were planned and executed through a collaborative effort in which an Indigenous Elder advisory council from Kotzebue and scientists participated in co-production of hypotheses and observational research, including a stronger understanding of the physical properties of sea ice during spring melt. Here we present the results of observations performed using high-endurance, fixed-wing uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) containing custom-built scientific payloads. Repeated flights over the measurement period captured the early stages of the transition from a white, snow-covered state to a broken-up, bare blue-green state. We found that the reflectance of sea ice features depends strongly on their size. Snow patches get darker as they get smaller, an effect owed to the geometric relationship between the bright interior and the darker, melting feature edges. Conversely, bare patches get darker as they get larger. For the largest ice features observed, bare blue-green ice patches were found to be ≈ 20 \% less reflective than average across all observational cases, while large snowy white ice patches were found to be ≈ 20 \% more reflective than that same average.},

	abstract = {Numerical wave models have been developed to reproduce the evolution of waves generated in all directions and over a wide range of wavelengths. The amount of wave energy in the different directions and wavelength is the result of a number of physical processes that are not well understood and that may not be represented in parameterizations. Models have generally been tuned to reproduce dominant wave properties: significant wave height, mean direction, dominant wavelengths. A recent update in wave dissipation parameterizations has shown that it can produce realistic energy levels and directional distribution for shorter waves too. Here, we show that this new formulation of the wave energy sink can reproduce the variability of measured infrasound power below a frequency of 2 Hz, associated with a large energy level of waves propagating perpendicular to the wind, for waves with frequencies up to 1 Hz. The details are sensitive to the balance between the non-linear transfer of energy away from the wind direction, and the influence of dominant and relatively long waves on the dissipation of shorter waves in other directions.},

	abstract = {The role of microscale wave breaking in controlling the air-water transfer of heat and gas is investigated in a laboratory wind-wave tank. The local heat transfer velocity, kH, is measured using an active infrared technique and the tank-averaged gas transfer velocity, kG, is measured using conservative mass balances. Simultaneous, colocated infrared and wave slope imagery show that wave-related areas of thermal boundary layer disruption and renewal are the turbulent wakes of microscale breaking waves, or microbreakers. The fractional area coverage of microbreakers, AB, is found to be 0.10.4 in the wind speed range 4.29.3 m s1 for cleaned and surfactant-influenced surfaces, and kH and kG are correlated with AB. The correlation of kH with AB is independent of fetch and the presence of surfactants, while that for kG with AB depends on surfactants. Additionally, AB is correlated with the mean square wave slope, hS2 correlate for kG in previous studies. The ratio of kH measured inside and outside the microbreaker wakes is 3.4, demonstrating that at these wind speeds, up to 75\% of the transfer is the direct result of microbreaking. These results provide quantitative evidence that microbreaking is the dominant mechanism contributing to air-water heat and gas transfer at low to moderate wind speeds.},

Lond. A., vol. 369, 1979, pp. 105–114; MNLSE). A new derivation of the spatial MNLSE, by a direct application of Whitham’s method, elucidates its variational structure. Using this formalism, we derive a set of conserved quantities and moment evolution equations. Next, by examining the MNLSE in the limit of vanishing linear dispersion, analytic solutions can be found. These solutions then serve as trial functions, which when substituted into the moment evolution equations form a closed set of equations, allowing for a qualitative and quantitative examination of the MNLSE without resorting to numerically solving the full equation. To examine the theory we consider initially symmetric, chirped and unchirped wave packets, chosen to induce wave focusing and steepening. By employing the ansatz for the trial function discussed above, we predict, a priori , the evolution of the packet. It is found that the speed of wave packets governed by the MNLSE depends on their amplitude, and in particular wave groups speed up as they focus. Next, we characterize the asymmetric growth of the wave envelope, and explain the steepening of the forward face of the initially symmetric wave packet. As the packet focuses, its variance decreases, as does the chirp of the signal. These theoretical results are then compared with the numerical predictions of the MNLSE, and agreement for small values of fetch is found. Finally, we discuss the results in the context of existing theoretical, numerical and laboratory studies.},

Pressure and velocity spectra and cross-spectra are in excellent agreement with (linear) free wave transfer functions, even at (and higher than) twice the spectral peak frequency where nonlinearities (forced secondary waves) are expected to be important. Theoretical predictions show that although secondary waves sometimes contribute a significant fraction of the energy observed at double swell and sea frequencies, their effect on velocity-pressure transfer functions is small. However, forced waves are more apparent in deviations from Gaussian statistics. Good agreement between observed and predicted third-order statistics shows that Hasselmann's weakly nonlinear theory accurately describes the secondary pressure and orbital velocity (both horizontal and vertical components) field at double swell and sea frequencies, even for moderately large (0(0.1–0.2)) values of the nonlinear perturbation parameter. Only with near-breaking swell and relatively strong nonlinearities (perturbation parameter ≈ 0.22), do the observed third-order statistics diverge significantly from Hasselmann's theory.},

The problems, which are obtained at the different orders of approximation, are characterized by a further parameter which is the ratio between the thickness of the bottom boundary layer and the length of the waves and turns out to be even smaller than the wave steepness. However, the solution is determined from the bottom up to the free surface, without the need to split the fluid domain into a core region and viscous boundary layers. Moreover, the procedure, which is employed to solve the problems at the different orders of approximation, reduces them to one-dimensional problems. Therefore, the solution for arbitrary angles between the direction of the steady current and that of wave propagation can be easily obtained.

Owing to the heterogeneous nature of the near shore consisting of nonbreaking shoaling waves and breaking surfzone waves, the surfzone wind stress source region is estimated from the footprint probability distribution derived for stable and unstable atmospheric conditions. An empirical model developed for estimating the Cd for open-ocean foam coverage dependent on wind speed is modified for foam coverage owing to depth-limited wave breaking within the surfzone.

The areas under investigation are located at three beaches in Monterey Bay, CA, USA. The sharp-interface immersed boundary method is employed to resolve the land topography down to grid scale. We have considered real-time and what-if cases. In the real-time cases, measurement data and realistic land topographies are directly incorporated. In the what-if cases, the effects of different scenarios of wind speed, wind direction, and terrain pattern on the momentum flux at the beach are studied. The LES results are compared with simulations using the Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) and field measurement data. We find that the land topography imposes a critical influence on the ABL in the coastal area. The momentum fluxes obtained from our LES agree with measurement data. Our results indicate the importance of capturing the effects of land topographies in simulations.},

	abstract = {A systematic comparison of wind profiles and momentum exchange at a trade wind site outside Oahu, Hawaii and corresponding data from the Baltic Sea is presented. The trade wind data are to a very high degree swell dominated, whereas the Baltic Sea data include a more varied assortment of wave conditions, ranging from a pure growing sea to swell. In the trade wind region swell waves travel predominantly in the wind direction, while in the Baltic, significant cross-wind swells are also present. Showing the drag coefficient as a function of the 10-m wind speed demonstrates striking differences for unstable conditions with swell for the wind-speed range 2 m s(-1) {\textless} U (10) {\textless} 7 m s(-1), where the trade-wind site drag values are significantly larger than the corresponding Baltic Sea values. In striking contrast to this disagreement, other features studied are surprisingly similar between the two sites. Thus, exactly as found previously in Baltic Sea studies during unstable conditions and swell, the wind profile in light winds (3 m s(-1)) shows a wind maximum at around 7-8 m above the water, with close to constant wind speed above. Also, for slightly higher wind speeds (4 m s(-1) {\textless} U (10) {\textless} 7 m s(-1)), the similarity between wind profiles is striking, with a strong wind-speed increase below a height of about 7-8 m followed by a layer of virtually constant wind speed above. A consequence of these wind-profile features is that Monin-Obukhov similarity is no longer valid. At the trade-wind site this was observed to be the case even for wind speeds as high as 10 m s(-1). The turbulence kinetic energy budget was evaluated for four cases of 8-16 30- min periods at the trade-wind site, giving results that agree very well with corresponding figures from the Baltic Sea.},

	abstract = {An experimental study, investigating the mean flow and turbulence in the wind drift layer formed beneath short wind waves was conducted. The degree to which these flows resemble the flows that occur in boundary layers adjacent to solid walls (i.e. wall-layers) was examined. Simultaneous DPIV (digital particle image velocimetry) and infrared imagery were used to investigate these near-surface flows at a fetch of 5.5 m and wind speeds from 4.5 to 11 m s−1. These conditions produced short steep waves with dominant wavelengths from 6 cm to 18 cm. The mean velocity profiles in the wind drift layer were found to be logarithmic and the flow was hydrodynamically smooth at all wind speeds. The rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy was determined to be significantly greater in magnitude than would occur in a comparable wall-layer. Microscale breaking waves were detected using the DPIV data and the characteristics of breaking and non-breaking waves were compared. The percentage of microscale breaking waves increased abruptly from 11\% to 80\% as the wind speed increased from 4.5 to 7.4 m s− and then gradually increased to 90\% as the wind speed increased to 11 m s−. At a depth of 1 mm, the rate of dissipation was 1.7 to 3.2 times greater beneath microscale breaking waves compared to non-breaking waves. In the crest–trough region beneath microscale breaking waves, 40\% to 50\% of the dissipation was associated with wave breaking. These results demonstrated that the enhanced near-surface turbulence in the wind drift layer was the result of microscale wave breaking. It was determined that the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy due to wave breaking is a function of depth, friction velocity, wave height and phase speed as proposed by Terray et al. (1996). Vertical profiles of the rate of dissipation showed that beneath microscale breaking waves there were two distinct layers. Immediately beneath the surface, the dissipation decayed as ζ−0.7 and below this in the second layer it decayed as ζ−2. The enhanced turbulence associated with microscale wave breaking was found to extend to a depth of approximately one significant wave height. The only similarity between the flows in these wind drift layers and wall-layers is that in both cases the mean velocity profiles are logarithmic. The fact that microscale breaking waves were responsible for 40\%–50\% of the near-surface turbulence supports the premise that microscale breaking waves play a significant role in enhancing the transfer of gas and heat across the air–sea interface.},

In particular, the fluxes of heat and gas rely on exchange processes through the molecular layers, which are usually located within the viscous layer, which is in turn modulated by the waves and the turbulence at the free surface. The understanding of the multiple interactions between molecular layers, viscous layers, waves, and turbulence is, therefore, paramount for an adequate parameterization of these fluxes. In this paper, the authors present evidence of a clear coupling between the surface waves and the surface turbulence. When averaged over time scales longer than the wave period, this coupling yields a spatial relationship between surface temperature, divergence, and vorticity fields that is consistent...},

These measurements are important for understanding and predicting material transport on the ocean surface as well as the vertical structure of the near-surface currents. These near-surface current observations were obtained during a field experiment in the northern Gulf of Mexico intended to test a new ultra-thin drifter design. During the experiment, thirty small cylindrical drifters with 5 cm height, twenty-eight similar drifters with 10 cm hull height, and fourteen drifters with 91 cm tall drogues centered at 100 cm depth were deployed within the footprint of coastal High-Frequency (HF) radar. Comparison of collocated velocity measurements reveals systematic differences in surface velocity estimates obtained from the different measurement techniques, as well as provides information on properties of the drifter behavior and near-surface shear. Results show that the HF radar velocity estimates had magnitudes significantly lower than the 5 cm and 10 cm drifter velocity of approximately 45\% and 35\%, respectively. The HF radar velocity magnitudes were similar to the drogued drifter velocity. Analysis of wave directional spectra measurements reveals that surface Stokes drift accounts for much of the velocity difference between the drogued drifters and the thin surface drifters except during times of wave breaking.},

	abstract = {Ocean surface currents and winds are tightly coupled essential climate variables, and, given their short time scales, observing them at the same time and resolution is of great interest. DopplerScatt is an airborne Ka-band scatterometer that has been developed under NASA\&rsquo;s Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) to provide a proof of concept of the feasability of measuring these variables using pencil-beam scanning Doppler scatterometry. In the first half of this paper, we present the Doppler scatterometer measurement and processing principles, paying particular attention to deriving a complete measurement error budget. Although Doppler radars have been used for the estimation of surface currents, pencil-beam Doppler Scatterometry offers challenges and opportunities that require separate treatment. The calibration of the Doppler measurement to remove platform and instrument biases has been a traditional challenge for Doppler systems, and we introduce several new techniques to mitigate these errors when conical scanning is used. The use of Ka-band for airborne Doppler scatterometry measurements is also new, and, in the second half of the paper, we examine the phenomenology of the mapping from radar cross section and radial velocity measurements to winds and surface currents. To this end, we present new Ka-band Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) for winds and surface currents obtained from multiple airborne campaigns. We find that the wind Ka-band GMF exhibits similar dependence on wind speed as that for Ku-band scatterometers, such as QuikSCAT, albeit with much greater upwind-crosswind modulation. The surface current GMF at Ka-band is significantly different from that at C-band, and, above 4.5 m/s has a weak dependence on wind speed, although still dependent on wind direction. We examine the effects of Bragg-wave modulation by long waves through a Modululation Transfer Function (MTF), and show that the observed surface current dependence on winds is consistent with past Ka-band MTF observations. Finally, we provide a preliminary validation of our geophysical retrievals, which will be expanded in subsequent publications. Our results indicate that Ka-band Doppler scatterometry could be a feasible method for wide-swath simultaneous measurements of winds and currents from space.},

	abstract = {Abstract Near-surface water velocities have been measured in the coastal zone of Lake Huron and Cape Cod Bay by tracking drifters and drogues using acoustic travel time and compass sighting techniques. The near-surface current, defined as the velocity of near-surface drifters and drogues relative to a drogue set at 1.8 m, varied on the depth scale on the order of 1 m, and was directed nearly parallel to the wind and to predominant wave propagation velocity. Velocity profiles were logarithmic with depth to order 1 m depth, and realistic values of stress were calculated using a law of the wall formula and a Kármán's constant of 0.4. Inferred roughness lengths were of the order of 30 cm. Anomalously high values of wind stress were inferred from velocity profiles observed during conditions of light wind and steady swell. These may be due to the similarity of Stokes drift distribution to turbulent shear flow profiles.},

The trajectories are initiated at locations representative of exploratory drilling sites around Cuba's Exclusive Economic Zone and integrated for ten days. The simulation is initialized for different seasons, using leeway-corrected observed winds, ocean currents, different climatologies, and a first-order Markov Lagrangian Stochastic Model. A Monte-Carlo scheme is used to parameterize oil weathering processes collectively. Overall, the simulations exhibit a strong seasonal dependence, where the Florida coast is most affected during the summer and the Cuban coast in the winter. Drilling sites at the center of the Straits show the largest impact on Florida. Cuba is most affected by shoreline locations. A significant amount of oil reaches the Florida coastline within two to ten days, and Cuba is potentially affected within hours. Many simulations project impacts for the Florida Keys, South Florida, and the north shore of Cuba.},

The main goal of the present work was to provide as comprehensive as possible set of experimental data that can be quantitatively compared with theoretical models. Measurements at various air flow rates and at numerous fetches were carried out in a small scale, closed-loop, 5 m long wind wave flume. Mean airflow velocity and fluctuations of the static pressure were measured at 38 vertical locations above the mean water surface simultaneously with determination of instantaneous water surface elevations by wave gauges. Instantaneous fluctuations of two velocity components were recorded for all vertical locations at a single fetch. The water surface drift velocity was determined by the particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) method. Evaluation of spatial growth rates of waves at various frequencies was performed using wave gauge records at various fetches. Phase relations between various signals were established by cross-spectral analysis. Waves' celerities and pressure fluctuation phase lags relative to the surface elevation were determined. Pressure values at the water surface were determined by extrapolating the measured vertical profile of pressure fluctuations to the mean water level and used to calculate the form drag and consequently the energy transfer rates from wind to waves. Directly obtained spatial growth rates were compared with those obtained from energy transfer calculations, as well as with previously available data.},

	abstract = {Biologically generated turbulence has been proposed as an important contributor to nutrient transport and ocean mixing1–3. However, to produce non-negligible transport and mixing, such turbulence must produce eddies at scales comparable to the length scales of stratification in the ocean. It has previously been argued that biologically generated turbulence is limited to the scale of the individual animals involved4, which would make turbulence created by highly abundant centimetre-scale zooplankton such as krill irrelevant to ocean mixing. Their small size notwithstanding, zooplankton form dense aggregations tens of metres in vertical extent as they undergo diurnal vertical migration over hundreds of metres3,5,6. This behaviour potentially introduces additional length scales—such as the scale of the aggregation—that are of relevance to animal interactions with the surrounding water column. Here we show that the collective vertical migration of centimetre-scale swimmers—as represented by the brine shrimp Artemia salina—generates aggregation-scale eddies that mix a stable density stratification, resulting in an effective turbulent diffusivity up to three orders of magnitude larger than the molecular diffusivity of salt. These observed large-scale mixing eddies are the result of flow in the wakes of the individual organisms coalescing to form a large-scale downward jet during upward swimming, even in the presence of a strong density stratification relative to typical values observed in the ocean. The results illustrate the potential for marine zooplankton to considerably alter the physical and biogeochemical structure of the water column, with potentially widespread effects owing to their high abundance in climatically important regions of the ocean7.},

Further 1600 wooden drifters, mostly driven by wind and Stokes drift, were released offshore in German waters. The detailed reports of stranded wooden drifters from members of the public, the majority of which are likely to be non-scientists, provided a valuable contribution to the drifter experiment demonstrating the usefulness of citizen science. In 2018, an extreme wind event reversed the circulation of North Sea for more than a month which resulted in a large number of wooden drifters being washed ashore on the British coast. Lagrangian numerical experiments, calibrated using data from the drifter observations, helped explain the anomalous transport and the reversal of the circulation at the sea surface and in deeper layers. The plausibility of similar events during past decades has also been estimated using data from atmospheric analyses.

Taking advantage of the known virtue of fish oil to still angry seas, a laboratory study has been made to analyse wind-wave generation and the interaction between wind waves, paddle waves, and airflow. This was done in a tank containing a thin fish-oil film uniformly spread on the water surface. The research was aimed, on the one hand, at quantifying for the first time the effectiveness of this surfactant at impeding the generation of wind waves and, on the other, at using the derived conditions to disentangle relevant mechanisms involved in the air–sea interaction. In particular, our main interest concerned the processes acting on the wind stress and on the wave growth. With oil on the water surface, we have found that in the wind-only condition (no paddle waves) the wave field does not grow from the rest condition. This equilibrium is altered by irregular paddle (long) waves, the generation and evolution of short waves (in clean water and with oil) being modified by their interaction with the orbital velocity of the long waves and their effect on the airflow. Paddle waves do grow under the action of wind, the amount being similar in clean and oily water conditions, a fact we ascribe to the similar distortion of the wind vertical profile in the two cases. We have also verified that the wind-supported stress on the oily water surface was able to generate a surface current, whose magnitude turns out to be comparable to the one in clean water. We stress the benefits of experiments with surfactants to explore in detail the physics at, and the exchanges across, the wavy and non-wavy air–water interface.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}]]{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The airflow dynamics above the air–sea interface are believed to have a significant impact on the fluxes of momentum and scalars across the ocean surface. We present an experimental study of the turbulent structure of the airflow above wind generated surface waves. Measurements, taken at a fetch of 22.7 m in University of Delaware’s large wind-wave–current facility, are reported for wind wave experiments with 10-m extrapolated wind speeds spanning from 2.19 m s−1 to 16.63 m s−1. In order to complete this study, we developed a complex imaging system, combining particle image velocimetry with laser induced fluorescence techniques. High resolution two-dimensional (18.7 cm x 9.7 cm) velocity fields were measured as close as 100 μm above the air–water interface (on average). In addition, we acquired high spatial and temporal resolution wave field data simultaneously with the airflow measurements. Using this imaging system, we were able to perform phase averaging and separate the turbulent, mean and wave-induced velocity fields. We observe direct evidence of airflow separation events past the crests of wind waves, starting at low to moderate wind speeds (U10{\textgreater}2.19 m s−1). In general, the turbulent boundary layer in the air is characterized by numerous velocity sweeps and ejections, accompanied by intense downwind-tilted spanwise vorticity (shear) layers stemming from the surface. We were able to directly observe these turbulent events, and estimate their statistical significance using quadrant analysis. These events become phase-locked in the presence of waves, and, when U10≥5 m s−1, they are accompanied by intermittent airflow separation events past wave crests. The production of TKE also shows wave phase locked features indicating that further analysis of the wave-coherent contributions to the TKE balance is needed.},

	abstract = {Wave data are required in many engineering applications. At locations where measured records are not available or are too short for design purposes, estimates of wave properties from numerical wave models are often used to characterise the expected wave climate. Typically, model predictions are validated against observations of the sea-state parameters, such as significant wave height, peak wave period, mean wave period and mean wave direction. However, while agreement between observed and predicted sea-state parameters can be good, in some cases the measured and predicted wave spectra can diverge significantly. In these circumstances, simple sea state parameters alone are not sufficient to describe the range of wave conditions that could arise at a given site. In this paper we present a new, alternative approach for assessing wave model performance by applying new parameterisation to the frequency wave spectrum. Seven parameters (significant wave height, peak frequency, peak energy density, squared Euclidean distance, skewness, kurtosis and mean width deviation) are used to better define the characteristics of unimodal wave spectra. Sensitivity tests are undertaken to analyse the performance and sensitivity of these parameters in identifying differences between observed and predicted wave spectra, using a range of idealised JONSWAP wave spectra. We demonstrate that comparing multiple parameters is a better method to distinguish differences between spectra than the results obtained using individual parameters in isolation. As such, application of two-dimensional validation matrices are proposed to provide a better, qualitative overview of the goodness of fit between observed and predicted wave spectra. The advantages of the new approach are demonstrated through validation of a hindcast spectral wave model at Hastings, southeast England. We believe that we have achieved our purpose here to start a discussion on alternative validation techniques that could be enhanced in the future.},

	abstract = {Two active optical techniques have been developed to measure the spatio-temporal structure of small scale waves with wavelength in the range of 2mm to 20 cm. One technique, the imaging slope gauge (ISG), is based on light refraction at the water surface and records im-age sequences of the wave slope at a maximum area of 1 m2. With the other technique, the reflective stereo slope gauge (RSSG), the water surface is illuminated from above by a monochromatic light source. Two CCD-cameras take stereo image sequences of the specular reflexes returned by the water surface. The wave height is calculated from the parallax between the right and left images with a fast multi-grid algorithm. This technique is also suitable for measurements in the field. The new instruments have successfully been used in the world\&apos;s largest wind/wave facilities (Delft Hydraulics, The Netherlands) in the frame of the international VIERS-1 project. This project inves-tigates the physical mechanisms of radar scatterometry. Besides our research groups the VIERS-1 participants are the Physics and Electronics Laboratory of the Organization for Applied Research (FEL-TNO), Technical Univ. of Delft, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Inst. (KNMI), Delft Hydraulics (WL), and the Directorate Tidal Waters of the Department of Harbors and Public Works (RWS-DGW). Two-dimensional wavenumber spectra, two-dimensional slope and one-dimensional height distributions calculated from the data of the two instruments are discussed.},

The type of flow considered is approximately parallel in the absence of the waves, being exemplified by two-dimensional boundary layers over a plane. Account is taken of viscosity; but, as the Reynolds number is assumed to be large, its effects are seen to be confined within narrow ‘friction layers’, one of which adjoins the wave and another surrounds the ‘critical point’ where the velocity of flow equals the wave velocity. The boundary conditions are made as general as possible by including the three cases where respectively the boundary is rigid, flexible yet still solid, or completely mobile as if it were the interface with a second fluid.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} We present a study on the interaction between wind and water waves with a broad-band spectrum using wave-phase-resolved simulation with long-term wave field evolution. The wind turbulence is computed using large-eddy simulation and the wave field is simulated using a high-order spectral method. Numerical experiments are carried out for turbulent wind blowing over a wave field initialised using the Joint North Sea Wave Project spectrum, with various wind speeds considered. The results show that the waves, together with the mean wind flow and large turbulent eddies, have a significant impact on the wavenumber–frequency spectrum of the wind turbulence. It is found that the shear stress contributed by sweep events in turbulent wind is greatly enhanced as a result of the waves. The dependence of the wave growth rate on the wave age is consistent with the results in the literature. The probability density function and high-order statistics of the wave surface elevation deviate from the Gaussian distribution, manifesting the nonlinearity of the wave field. The shape of the change in the spectrum of wind-waves resembles that of the nonlinear wave–wave interactions, indicating the dominant role played by the nonlinear interactions in the evolution of the wave spectrum.

	abstract = {Investigation of 37,106 ocean surface wave spectra from the Pacific, Atlantic Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that swell modulates the energy level of the high frequency tail of the wind-sea wave spectrum, altering sea surface roughness. With a mixture of sea and swell, the wind-sea part of spectra follows the well-known f-4 (equilibrium range) and f-5 (saturation range) power laws. Swell modulates the energy levels but does not change the power-law structure. For swell with minimal winds, the spectra follow the −4, −5 power-law paradigm, but energy correlates to swell steepness not wind speed. Swell shifts the transition between the two sub-ranges towards lower frequencies. For sea-swell mixtures, a modulation factor λ is proposed that depends on wind speed and swell steepness which allows parameterization of the spectral tail. Comparison of large swell with little wind to wind-sea spectra of same height and period, indicates that there is little difference in spectral shape and suggests that the Hasselmann Snl source term is likely the mechanism by which energy is transferred into the wind-sea tail causing the modulation. Analysis of 33,000+ directional spectra at Ocean Station Papa shows that the mean direction for the wind-sea high frequency tail is strongly correlated to wind direction, no matter the swell direction or steepness or level of swell dominance. An equation for the friction velocity of a sea state with swell (u*s) is developed, u∗s=λ1/2u∗o where u∗o is the friction velocity in the absence of swell, by neglect of the direct swell impact. Noting that this is only a partial estimate of the total measured stress, the prediction is evaluated for 3,000+ observed spectra yielding a correlation of 0.91 suggesting that it may be of consequence. Observations of u∗/u∗o suggest a dependence with swell steepness that is similar to that predicted by λ1/2. At low winds, λ1/2 overestimates the stress, but noting that it was derived absent the components from the swell frequencies. In the tail, the momentum transport is downward, while in the swell the transport is predominantly upward, suggests a possible correction for λ1/2. The case of a swell generated wind is discussed.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Sea surface waves are important for marine safety and coastal engineering, but mapping the wave properties at complex shorelines, such as coastal archipelagos, is challenging. The wave spectrum, E(f), contains a majority of the information about the wave field, and its properties have been studied for decades. Nevertheless, any systematic research into the wave spectrum in archipelagos has not been made. In this paper we present wave buoy measurements from 14 locations in the Finnish archipelago. The shape of the wave spectrum showed a systematic transition from a single-peaked spectrum to a spectrum with a wide frequency range having almost constant energy. The exact shape also depended on the wind direction, since the fetch, island, and bottom conditions are not isotropic. The deviation from the traditional spectral form is strong enough to have a measurable effect on the definitions of the significant wave height. The relation between the two definitions in the middle of the archipelago was H1/3=0.881Hs, but the ratio varied with the spectral width (Hs was defined using the variance). At this same location the average value of the single highest wave, Hmax∕Hs, was only 1.58. A wider archipelago spectrum was also associated with lower confidence limits for the significant wave height compared to the open sea (6 \% vs. 9 \%). The challenges caused by the instability of the peak frequency for an archipelago spectrum are presented, and the mean frequency, weighted with E(f)4, is proposed as a compromise between stability and bias with respect to the peak frequency. The possibility of using the frequency and width parameters of this study as a starting point for a new analytical parameterisation of an archipelago type spectrum is discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The impact of ocean surface waves on wind stress at the air–sea interface under low to moderate wind conditions was systematically investigated based on a simple constant flux model and flux measurements obtained from two coastal towers in the East China Sea and South China Sea. It is first revealed that the swell-induced perturbations can reach a height of nearly 30 m above the mean sea surface, and these perturbations disturb the overlying airflow under low wind and strong swell conditions. The wind profiles severely depart from the classical logarithmic profiles, and the deviations increase with the peak wave phase speeds. At wind speeds of less than 4 m s $^{\textrm{−1}}$ , an upward momentum transfer from the wave to the atmosphere is predicted, which is consistent with previous studies. A comparison between the observations and model indicates that the wind stress calculated by the model is largely consistent with the observational wind stress when considering the effects of surface waves, which provides a solution for accurately calculating wind stress in ocean and climate models. Furthermore, the surface waves at the air–sea interface invalidate the traditional Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), and this invalidity decreases as observational height increases. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A three-part algorithm is described and tested to provide robust bathymetry maps based solely on long time series observations of surface wave motions. The first phase consists of frequency-dependent characterization of the wave field in which dominant frequencies are estimated by Fourier transform while corresponding wave numbers are derived from spatial gradients in cross-spectral phase over analysis tiles that can be small, allowing high-spatial resolution. Coherent spatial structures at each frequency are extracted by frequency-dependent empirical orthogonal function (EOF). In phase two, depths are found that best fit weighted sets of frequency-wave number pairs. These are subsequently smoothed in time in phase 3 using a Kalman filter that fills gaps in coverage and objectively averages new estimates of variable quality with prior estimates. Objective confidence intervals are returned. Tests at Duck, NC, using 16 surveys collected over 2 years showed a bias and root-mean-square (RMS) error of 0.19 and 0.51 m, respectively but were largest near the offshore limits of analysis (roughly 500 m from the camera) and near the steep shoreline where analysis tiles mix information from waves, swash and static dry sand. Performance was excellent for small waves but degraded somewhat with increasing wave height. Sand bars and their small-scale alongshore variability were well resolved. A single ground truth survey from a dissipative, low-sloping beach (Agate Beach, OR) showed similar errors over a region that extended several kilometers from the camera and reached depths of 14 m.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Wave breaking is thought to be the dominant mechanism for energy loss by the surface wave field. Breaking results in energetic and highly turbulent velocity fields, concentrated within approximately one wave height of the surface. To make meaningful estimates of wave energy dissipation in the upper ocean, it is then necessary to make accurate measurements of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation very near the surface. However, the surface wave field makes measurements of turbulence at the air–sea interface challenging since the energy spectrum contains energy from both waves and turbulence over the same range of wavenumbers and frequencies. Furthermore, wave orbital velocities can advect the turbulent wake of instrumentation into the sampling volume of the instrument. In this work a new technique for measuring TKE dissipation at the sea surface that overcomes these difficulties is presented. Using a stereo pair of longwave infrared cameras, it is possible to reconstruct the surface displacement and velocity fields. The vorticity of that velocity field can then be considered to be representative of the rotational turbulence and not the irrotational wave orbital velocities. The turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate can then be calculated by comparing the vorticity spectrum to a universal spectrum. Average surface TKE dissipation calculated in this manner was found to be consistent with near-surface values from the literature, and time-dependent dissipation was found to depend on breaking.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The dimensions of SUSTAIN wind-wave-current tunnel are 18 m long, 6 m wide, and 2 m high, uniquely allowing for freely forming turbulence unconstrained by side walls. The grid of input parameters covered a range of wave steepness (ak: 0–0.27) within each investigated wind speed (U10: 2–20 m/s), allowing for the isolation of wave effects on the turbulence driven by both wind and waves. The response of turbulence to each pair of wind-wave parameters was measured in steady-state conditions (after 20+ min of settling time) by a suite of nonintrusive turbulence visualization techniques, located at 10 m fetch. These included 3-D visualization of water tracing dye entrainment by turbulence, underwater particle image velocimetry, and passive and active thermal imagery resolving surface skin temperature and velocity fluctuations. The resulting data set includes both qualitative 3-D view of subsurface turbulent structures and precise quantitative turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) measurements mapped out in response to the grid of input parameters. In lower winds, TKE was found to grow substantially in response to increasing wave steepness, in line with the expected effect of increasing wave forcing. However, in higher winds the effect of increasing wave steepness on TKE was found to be negative. It is hypothesized to be due to the rise of airflow separation, effectively sheltering much of the water surface from turbulence production by wind friction.},

This is likely to have an effect on winds over the Arctic basin because of changes in atmospheric stability, surface roughness, and/or baroclinicity. Here we identify patterns of wind changes in all seasons across the Arctic and their likely causal mechanisms, particularly those associated with sea ice loss. Output from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble Project (CESM-LE) was analyzed for the recent past (primarily 1971?2000) and future (2071?2100). Mean near-surface wind speeds over the Arctic Ocean are projected to increase by late century in all seasons but especially during autumn and winter, when they strengthen by up to 50\% locally. The most extreme wind speeds in the 95th percentile change even more, increasing in frequency by up to 100\%. The strengthened winds are closely linked to decreasing surface roughness and lower-tropospheric stability resulting from the loss of sea ice cover and consequent surface warming (exceeding 20°C warmer in the central Arctic in autumn and winter), as well as local changes in the storm track. The implications of stronger future winds include increased coastal and navigational hazards. Our findings suggest that increasing winds, along with reduction of sea ice, rising sea level, and thawing permafrost, represent another important contributor to the growing problem of Arctic coastal erosion.},

	abstract = {Summary The atmosphere over sea ice comprises a complex but important system of linked processes impacting the sea ice. Atmospheric energy fluxes explain much of the annual cycle of sea-ice mass balance, while atmospheric momentum flux is a primary parameter governing the movement of sea ice. Key atmospheric components include the structure and stability of the atmospheric boundary layer, cloud macro- and microphysics, vertical mixing processes, and free-tropospheric advection of heat, moisture, and aerosols. Radiative and turbulent energy fluxes are key for the surface energy budget. Interactions between atmospheric radiative and turbulent processes and sea-ice surface characteristics, such as melt ponds, snow cover, and leads, determine the quantitative impacts on sea-ice mass balance. Atmospheric boundary-layer stability and processes modulate momentum transport. Several atmospheric components, such as cloud structure and stable boundary-layer mixing, are poorly represented in models, producing erroneous fluxes in regional and global climate models and in reanalyses.},

(1999, 2008). While the earlier 1999 work provides a longer historical record of the regional changes, the latter offers a more refined analysis, over a sizable portion of the Arctic Ocean supported by a much stronger and richer data set. Within the data release area (DRA) of declassified submarine sonar measurements (covering ?38\% of the Arctic Ocean), the overall mean winter thickness of 3.64 m in 1980 can be compared to a 1.89 m mean during the last winter of the ICESat record?an astonishing decrease of 1.75 m in thickness. Between 1975 and 2000, the steepest rate of decrease is ?0.08 m/yr in 1990 compared to a slightly higher winter/summer rate of ?0.10/?0.20 m/yr in the five-year ICESat record (2003?2008). Prior to 1997, ice extent in the DRA was {\textgreater}90\% during the summer minimum. This can be contrasted to the gradual decrease in the early 2000s followed by an abrupt drop to {\textless}55\% during the record setting minimum in 2007. This combined analysis shows a long-term trend of sea ice thinning over submarine and ICESat records that span five decades.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111688},
	abstract = {A wavelet based method for bathymetry retrieval from X-band radar images is proposed. The method combines traditional Fast Fourier Transform techniques for retrieving peak frequency maps by evaluating the spectral peaks in the time domain, and a localized 2D Continuous Wavelet Transform for retrieving the corresponding peak wavenumbers. The main improvements of the new method compared to conventional FFT-based methods are as follows: a) the wavelet-based approach is localized - naturally fitting the inhomogeneous conditions typically found in the nearshore environment; b) it is continuous and uses wave phase information providing smooth bathymetry maps with good accuracy (RMSE in the range 2.6–6.6\% of the maximum water depth); c) it requires relatively small number of successive images without the limitation of requiring a uniform time step. In order to verify the proposed method, 2D simulations of wave shoaling and refraction were performed for different sea conditions and over several bottom topographies. A radar image model including tilt and shadowing modulations together with speckle noise was applied to the simulated surface elevations to provide synthetic radar images. The method's ability to reconstruct the original bathymetry is shown to be robust in intermediate to shallow water depths (kph {\textless} 1) for all cases. The method was also applied to real data acquired in Sylt island (Germany). A comparison between a bathymetric survey held prior to a storm and a radar reconstructed one during the storm shows very good agreement. These results reassure the high capability of this new method to be used in operational settings.},

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of the airflow over periodic traveling waves were performed to investigate the applicability of two mechanisms related to momentum transfer from the turbulent airflow to the traveling waves, i.e., the critical-layer mechanism and the nonseparated sheltering. We found three regimes classified by the wave age. In the first regime at low wave ages (2 ≤ c/u* ≤ 4), the critical height is located in the thin inner region where nonseparated sheltering works, and the perturbations of the shear stress in the inner region directly affect the streamwise phase of pressure on the wave surface. In the second regime at intermediate wave ages (4 {\textless} c/u* ≤ 12), the critical layer is located in the thick inner region and has a strong link to momentum transfer across the interfacial wave. In particular, the phase of wave-induced pressure on the wave surface φp̃bot is determined by the phase of wave-induced vertical velocity at the critical height φw̃z=zc as φp̃bot ≈φw̃z=zc + π/2. In this regime, the growth rate of the interfacial wave is predicted well by the critical-layer mechanism. In the third regime at high wave ages (c/u* ≥ 16), the critical height is in the outer region far above the inner region, and the assumption of the critical-layer mechanism is better satisfied. However, momentum transfer across the interface in this regime is determined mainly by the local flow in the inner region and it is only weakly affected by the flow at the critical height. Then, the nonseparated sheltering works also at this high wave age. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

The time-averaged turbulence structure over the fixed flat bed was dynamically similar to flow over a flat bed with active sediment transport. The flow field over 2-D dunes conforms with previous observations of flow over mobile and fixed bed forms. Bed form three dimensionality significantly altered the flow field observed over the 2-D dunes. Lobe-shaped dune crest lines, curved crests with topographic highs that bowed downstream, enhanced the level of turbulence producing a better defined wake structure and more vigorous mixing in the separation cell than observed over 2-D dunes. Saddle-shaped dune crest lines, curved crests with topographic highs that bowed upstream, diminished the level of turbulence suppressing a well-defined wake structure and mixing in the flow separation cell. Flow over sinuous-crested bed forms with lobes and saddles was dynamically similar to flow over full width bed forms. Development of in-line paired saddles and lobes in the downstream direction appears to be controlled by near-bed velocity gradients, which were larger over saddles and smaller over lobes. These gradients control local boundary shear stress patterns that should promote scour and high transport rates over saddles and deposition on lobes. Two-dimensional and 3-D bed forms with the same height and length offered different levels of flow resistance. The flow observations support the idea that saddles decrease flow resistance and lobes increase flow resistance relative to a 2-D dune. Bed form crests composed of irregularly spaced lobes and saddles suppressed turbulent flow structure development and reduced drag by 20\% below levels for 2-D or sinuous crested dunes. The results suggest that bed form crest shape needs to be accounted for in flow resistance calculations and that a single drag coefficient is inadequate where the bed can evolve through 2-D, 3-D, and irregular 3-D bed form states.},

	doi = {10.1016/J.RSE.2019.111607},
	abstract = {Earth remote sensing using reflected GNSS signals is currently an emerging trend especially in ocean surface wind measurements. Unlike the existing scatterometer missions, GNSS-R uses L-Band navigation signals that can penetrate through clouds and rain. Rain may have a negligible impact on the transmitted signal in terms of path attenuation at this wavelength. However, there are other effects due to rain, such as changes in surface roughness and rain induced local winds, which can significantly alter the measurements. Currently, there is no observation-based characterization of all possible impacts of rain on radar forward scatter, which is the nature of operation of GNSS-R missions. In this study, we propose a 3-fold rain model which accounts for attenuation, surface effects of rain and rain induced local winds. We utilize the large dataset of measurements made by the CYGNSS mission to separate these different effects of rain. The attenuation model suggests that a total of at least 96\% transmissivity exists at L-Band up to a rain rate of 30 mm/h. A perturbation model is used to characterize the other rain effects. It suggests that rain is accompanied by an overall reduction in the scattering cross-section of the ocean surface and, most importantly, this effect is observed only up to surface wind speeds of 15 m/s, beyond which the gravity capillary waves dominate the scattering in the quasi-specular direction. Observations also suggest that, at very low wind speeds, the lower bound on wavenumber of the portion of the surface roughness spectrum that influences the measurements deviates from the geometric optics approximation normally used. This work binds together several rain-related phenomena and enhances our overall understanding of rain effects on GNSS-R measurements.},

The state estimation framework employed for wind estimation was adapted to a set of closed-loop rigid body models identified for an off-the-shelf quadrotor. The quadrotor models used for wind estimation were characterized for hovering and steady ascending flight conditions ranging between 0 and 2 m/s. The closed-loop models were obtained using system identification algorithms to determine model structures and estimate model parameters. The wind measurement method was validated experimentally above the Virginia Tech Kentland Experimental Aircraft Systems Laboratory by comparing quadrotor and independent sensor measurements from a sonic anemometer and two SoDAR instruments. Comparison results demonstrated quadrotor wind estimation in close agreement with the independent wind velocity measurements. However, horizontal wind velocity profiles were difficult to validate using time-synchronized SoDAR measurements. Analysis of the noise intensity and signal-to-noise ratio of the SoDARs proved that close-proximity quadrotor operations can corrupt wind measurement from SoDARs, which has not previously been reported.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The frequency response characteristics of each model were then examined to determine the range of wind fluctuations captured with each model. Analysis shows that the bandwidth of each windsensing algorithm increases with the fidelity of the model being used. To validate wind estimation results based on the three motion models, field experiments were performed in which the quadrotor was stationed in hover beside a sonic anemometer mounted 10mabove the ground on a weather tower in Innisfree, Virginia. Analysis of the resulting data indicates that the accuracy of wind direction estimates was comparable for all three model-based estimation schemes, but the rigid-body model yields more accurate estimates of wind speed. Because the vehicle dynamics will vary with small changes to the platform or operation at different altitudes, the relative ease with which a rigid-body model may be identified further supports its use for wind estimation from quadrotor motion.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. The state and composition of the lowest part of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), i.e., the atmospheric surface layer (SL), reflects the interactions of external forcing, land surface, vegetation, human influence and the atmosphere. Vertical profiles of atmospheric variables in the SL at high spatial (meters) and temporal (1 Hz and better) resolution increase our understanding of these interactions but are still challenging to measure appropriately. Traditional ground-based observations include towers that often cover only a few measurement heights at a fixed location. At the same time, most remote sensing techniques and aircraft measurements have limitations to achieve sufficient detail close to the ground (up to 50 m). Vertical and horizontal transects of the PBL can be complemented by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Our aim in this case study is to assess the use of a multicopter-type UAV for the spatial sampling of air and simultaneously the sensing of meteorological variables for the study of the surface exchange processes. To this end, a UAV was equipped with onboard air temperature and humidity sensors, while wind conditions were determined from the UAV's flight control sensors. Further, the UAV was used to systematically change the location of a sample inlet connected to a sample tube, allowing the observation of methane abundance using a ground-based analyzer. Vertical methane gradients of about 0.3 ppm were found during stable atmospheric conditions. Our results showed that both methane and meteorological conditions were in agreement with other observations at the site during the ScaleX-2015 campaign. The multicopter-type UAV was capable of simultaneous in situ sensing of meteorological state variables and sampling of air up to 50 m above the surface, which extended the vertical profile height of existing tower-based infrastructure by a factor of 5.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recent advances in the understanding and modeling capability of open ocean currents have revealed the ubiquitous presence of eddies, fronts, and filaments at scales 10–100 km. Based on realistic numerical models, we show that these structures can be the main source of variability in significant wave heights at scales less than 200 km, including important variations down to 10 km. Model results are consistent with wave height variations along satellite altimeter tracks, resolved at scales larger than 50 km. The spectrum of significant wave heights is found to be of the order of 70‹Hs›2/(g2‹Tm0,-1›) times the current spectrum, where ‹Hs› is the spatially averaged significant wave height, ‹Tm0, -1› is the energy-averaged period, and g is the gravity acceleration. This variability induced by currents has been largely overlooked in spite of its relevance for extreme wave heights and remote sensing.},

However, it remains unclear how waves are modified by large-scale ocean currents under storm conditions, when waves are aligned with the storm-driven circulation and tightly coupled to the overlying wind field. Hurricane Matthew (2016) impacted the U.S. Southeast coast, causing extensive coastal change due to large waves and elevated water levels. The hurricane traveled on the continental shelf parallel to the SAB coastline, with the right side of the hurricane directly over the Gulf Stream. Using the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere– Wave–Sediment Transport modeling system, we investigate wave–current interaction between Hurricane Matthew and the Gulf Stream. The model simulates ocean currents and waves over a grid encompassing the U.S. East Coast, with varied coupling of the hydrodynamic and wave components to isolate the effect of the currents on the waves, and the effect of the Gulf Stream relative to storm-driven circulation. The Gulf Stream modifies the direction of the storm-driven currents beneath the right side of the hurricane. Waves transitioned from following currents that result in wave lengthening, through negative current gradients that result in wave steepening and dissipation. Wave–current interaction over the Gulf Stream modified maximum coastal total water levels and changed incident wave directions at the coast by up to 208, with strong implications for the morphodynamic response and stability of the coast to the hurricane.},

	abstract = {Air–sea interaction at ocean fronts and eddies exhibits positive correlation between sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed, and heat fluxes out of the ocean, indicating that the ocean is forcing the atmosphere. This contrasts with larger scale climate modes where the negative correlations suggest that the atmosphere is driving the system. This paper examines the physical processes that lie behind the interaction of sharp SST gradients and the overlying marine atmospheric boundary layer and deeper atmosphere, using high resolution satellite data, field data and numerical models. The importance of different physical mechanisms of atmospheric response to SST gradients, such as the effect of surface stability variations on momentum transfer, pressure gradients, secondary circulations and cloud cover will be assessed. The atmospheric response is known to create small-scale wind stress curl and divergence anomalies, and a discussion of the feedback of these features onto the ocean will also be presented. These processes will be compared and contrasted for different regions such as the Equatorial Front in the Eastern Pacific, and oceanic fronts in mid-latitudes such as the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, and Agulhas Return Current.},

	abstract = {The sub-gridscale floe size and thickness distribution (FSTD) is an emerging climate variable, playing a leading-order role in the coupling between sea ice, the ocean, and the atmosphere. The FSTD, however, is difficult to measure given the vast range of horizontal scales of individual floes, leading to the common use of power-law scaling to describe it. The evolution of a coupled mixed-layer-FSTD model of a typical marginal ice zone is explicitly simulated here, to develop a deeper understanding of how processes active at the floe scale may or may not lead to scaling laws in the floe size distribution. The time evolution of mean quantities obtained from the FSTD (sea ice concentration, mean thickness, volume) is complex even in simple scenarios, suggesting that these quantities, which affect climate feedbacks, should be carefully calculated in climate models. The emergence of FSTDs with multiple separate power-law regimes, as seen in observations, is found to be due to the combination of multiple scale-selective processes. Limitations in assuming a power-law FSTD are carefully analyzed, applying methods used in observations to FSTD model output. Two important sources of error are identified that may lead to model biases: one when observing an insufficiently small range of floe sizes, and one from the fact that floe-scale processes often do not produce power-law behavior. These two sources of error may easily lead to biases in mean quantities derived from the FSTD of greater than 100\%, and therefore biases in modeled sea ice evolution.},

In order to help develop a predictive theoretical approach to studying melting sea ice, and the resulting patterns of light and dark regions on its surface in particular, we look to the statistical mechanics of phase transitions and introduce a two-dimensional random field Ising model which accounts for only the most basic physics in the system. The ponds are identified as metastable states in the model, where the binary spin variable corresponds to the presence of melt water or ice on the sea ice surface. With the lattice spacing determined by snow topography data as the only measured parameter input into the model, energy minimization drives the system toward realistic pond configurations from an initially random state. The model captures the essential mechanism of pattern formation of Arctic melt ponds, with predictions that agree very closely with observed scaling of pond sizes and transition in pond fractal dimension.},

Sea ice albedo, a key parameter in climate modeling, is determined by the complex evolution of melt pond configurations. In fact, ice–albedo feedback has played a major role in the recent declines of the summer Arctic sea ice pack. However, understanding melt pond evolution remains a significant challenge to improving climate projections. By analyzing area–perimeter data from hundreds of thousands of melt ponds, we find here an unexpected separation of scales, where pond fractal dimension \textit{D} transitions from 1 to 2 around a critical length scale of 100 m$^{\textrm{2}}$ in area. Pond complexity increases rapidly through the transition as smaller ponds coalesce to form large connected regions, and reaches a maximum for ponds larger than 1000 m$^{\textrm{2}}$, whose boundaries resemble space-filling curves, with \textit{D} \&asymp; 2. These universal features of Arctic melt pond evolution are similar to phase transitions in statistical physics. The results impact sea ice albedo, the transmitted radiation fields under melting sea ice, the heat balance of sea ice and the upper ocean, and biological productivity such as under ice phytoplankton blooms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A detailed understanding of how sunlight is reflected and transmitted by the sea ice cover is needed for an accurate representation of critical processes in climate and ecosystem models, such as the ice–albedo feedback. Due to the challenges associated with ice internal measurements, most information about radiative transfer in sea ice has been gained by optical measurements above and below the sea ice. To improve our understanding of radiative transfer processes within the ice itself, we developed a new kind of instrument equipped with a number of multispectral light sensors that can be frozen into the ice. A first prototype consisting of a 2.3 m long chain of 48 sideward planar irradiance sensors with a vertical spacing of 0.05 m was deployed at the geographic North Pole in late August 2018, providing autonomous, vertically resolved light measurements within the ice cover during the autumn season. Here we present the first results of this instrument, discuss the advantages and application of the prototype, and provide first new insights into the spatiotemporal aspect of radiative transfer within the sea ice itself. In particular, we investigate how measured attenuation coefficients relate to the optical properties of the ice pack and show that sideward planar irradiance measurements are equivalent to measurements of total scalar irradiance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, the melt pond reflectance is considered in the framework of radiative transfer theory. The melt pond is modeled as a plane-parallel layer of pure water upon a layer of sea ice (the pond bottom). We consider pond reflection as comprising Fresnel reflection by the water surface and multiple reflections between the pond surface and its bottom, which is assumed to be Lambertian. In order to give a description of how to find the pond bottom albedo, we investigate the inherent optical properties of sea ice. Using the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation approach to light scattering by non-spherical particles (brine inclusions) and Mie solution for spherical particles (air bubbles), we conclude that the transport scattering coefficient in sea ice is a spectrally independent value. Then, within the two-stream approximation of the radiative transfer theory, we show that the under-pond ice spectral albedo is determined by two independent scalar values: the transport scattering coefficient and ice layer thickness. Given the pond depth and bottom albedo values, the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and albedo of a pond can be calculated with analytical formulas. Thus, the main reflective properties of the melt pond, including their spectral dependence, are determined by only three independent parameters: pond depth \textit{z}, ice layer thickness \textit{H}, and transport scattering coefficient of ice \textit{σ}$_{\textrm{t}}$.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}The effects of the incident conditions and the atmosphere state are examined. It is clearly shown that atmospheric correction is necessary even for in situ measurements. The atmospheric correction procedure has been used in the model verification. The optical model developed is verified with data from in situ measurements made during three field campaigns performed on landfast and pack ice in the Arctic. The measured pond albedo spectra were fitted with the modeled spectra by varying the pond parameters (\textit{z}, \textit{H}, and \textit{σ}$_{\textrm{t}}$). The coincidence of the measured and fitted spectra demonstrates good performance of the model: it is able to reproduce the albedo spectrum in the visible range with RMSD that does not exceed 1.5 \% for a wide variety of melt pond types observed in the Arctic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These surfaces control albedo and exert tremendous influence over the energy balance in the Arctic. Increasingly available meter- to decimeter-scale resolution optical imagery captures the evolution of the ice and ocean surface state visually, but methods for quantifying coverage of key surface types from raw imagery are not yet well established. Here we present an open-source system designed to provide a standardized, automated, and reproducible technique for processing optical imagery of sea ice. The method classifies surface coverage into three main categories: snow and bare ice, melt ponds and submerged ice, and open water. The method is demonstrated on imagery from four sensor platforms and on imagery spanning from spring thaw to fall freeze-up. Tests show the classification accuracy of this method typically exceeds 96 \%. To facilitate scientific use, we evaluate the minimum observation area required for reporting a representative sample of surface coverage. We provide an open-source distribution of this algorithm and associated training datasets and suggest the community consider this a step towards standardizing optical sea ice imagery processing. We hope to encourage future collaborative efforts to improve the code base and to analyze large datasets of optical sea ice imagery.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The approximation, derived to first order of deviation from potential flow, is shown to produce good approximations at all wavelengths for a wide range of naturally occuring shear flows as well as widely used model flows. The relation reduces in many cases to a 3-D generalization of the much used approximation by Skop (1987), developed further by Kirby and Chen (1989), but is shown to be more robust, succeeding in situations where the Kirby and Chen model fails. The two approximations incur the same numerical cost and difficulty. While the Kirby and Chen approximation is excellent for a wide range of currents, the exact criteria for its applicability have not been known. We explain the apparently serendipitous success of the latter and derive proper conditions of applicability for both approximate dispersion relations. Our new model has a greater range of applicability. A second order approximation is also derived. It greatly improves accuracy, which is shown to be important in difficult cases. It has an advantage over the corresponding second-order expression proposed by Kirby and Chen that its criterion of accuracy is explicitly known, which is not currently the case for the latter to our knowledge. Our second-order term is also arguably significantly simpler to implement, and more physically transparent, than its sibling due to Kirby and Chen.},

However, ocean surface gravity waves (hereafter waves) can alter the magnitude and direction of the ocean-side stress (τoc) from the air-side stress (τa). This is rarely considered in coupled climate and forecast models. Based on a 30-year wave hindcast, the redistribution of the global wind stress and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) flux by waves was investigated. Waves play a more important role in the windy oceans in middle and high latitudes than that in the oceans in the tropics (i.e., the central portion of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans). On average, the relative difference between τoc and τa, γτ, can be up to 6\% in middle and high latitudes. The frequency of occurrence of γτ {\textgreater} 9\% can be up to 10\% in the windy extratropics. The directional difference between τoc and τa exceeds 3.5° in the middle and high latitudes 10\% of the time. The difference between τoc and τa becomes more significant closer to the coasts of the continents due to strong wind gradients. The friction velocity-based approach overestimates (underestimates) the breaking-induced TKE flux in the tropics (middle and high latitudes). The findings presented in the current study show that coupled climate and earth system models would clearly benefit from the inclusion of a wave model.},

While the drag coefficient weakly depends on wind speed in this wind speed range, it shows stronger dependence on sea states. In particular, it is significantly reduced when the misalignment angle between the dominant wave direction and the wind direction exceeds about 45°, a feature which is underestimated by current models of sea state dependent drag coefficient. Since the misaligned swell is more common in the far front and in the left front quadrant of the storm (in the Northern Hemisphere), the drag coefficient also tends to be lower in these areas and shows a distinct spatial distribution. Our results therefore support ongoing efforts to develop and implement sea state dependent parameterizations of the drag coefficient in tropical cyclone conditions.},

	abstract = {Vegetation is one of the most important components of nature-based coastal protection due to its ability to dissipate wave energy. To quantify the wave attenuation by vegetation, traditional analytical models assume rigid vegetation and use bulk drag coefficient (CD) or effective blade length (le) techniques to consider the effects of blade motion, where CD and le are conventionally fitted as a function of KC (the Keulegan–Carpenter number) and CaL (with Ca the Cauchy number and L the ratio of the blade length to wave excursion), respectively. These parameters do not include the full blade dynamics and so the empirical formulas of CD and le are different for varying vegetation with blade dynamics. To obtain analytical solutions for CD and le, an analytical wave attenuation model for flexible vegetation (and kelp) was developed in this study by simplifying and linearizing the blade motion. Compared with a wide range of experiments for both submerged vegetation and suspended kelp canopies, the simplified analytical model underestimated the wave decay coefficient (kD) by 27\%, but with a small NRMSE (normalized root mean square error by the range of the measured data) of 0.054. In comparison, the numerical model with full nonlinearity underestimated the wave decay coefficient by 11.7\% with NRMSE=0.063. To reduce the underestimation of the analytical model due to the simplification and linearization, a modification factor defined as the ratio of the numerically calculated kD and the analytically calculated kD was fitted. With the modification factor, the underestimation of the analytical model was reduced to 10.1\%. Based on the analytical model, analytical solutions for CD and le were derived, which showed a similar precision with the experimentally fitted CD and le based on KC and CaL, respectively. Thus, the analytical solutions for CD and le could be a reliable alternative when the experimentally calibrated CD and le are not available. Using the analytical wave attenuation model, a case study showed the wave attenuation by cultivated Saccharina latissima changes seasonally with the kelp growth. When the kelp blade reaches 2.4 m long after 7 months of growth, the kelp farms with 50 longlines (over a distance of 200 m in the direction of wave propagation) in 8 m-deep water may attenuate wave energy by 29\% for 1 m-high waves with the period of 6 s. The wave attenuation can be enhanced to 43\% when the farms are located in 5 m-deep water. To provide considerable wave attenuation of kelp with adequate long blades around the year, biennial and multiple partial harvesting techniques are recommended.},

Ringed seals Pusa hispida (‘natchiq’ in Iñupiaq) use snow-covered dens on sea ice for pupping, but quantitative information on denning habitat requirements is limited, and it is unknown how changes in snow depth and sea-ice extent will impact ringed seals. Here, an Indigenous Elder Advisory Council and a multidisciplinary group of scientists used knowledge co-production to quantify fine-scale ringed seal habitat selection patterns in Kotzebue Sound, Alaska (USA), during a year of unprecedentedly limited snow and sea-ice availability. Together, we conducted unoccupied aerial vehicle-based surveys during spring 2019 and related seal counts to survey date, bathymetry, and novel proxies for snow depth and surface roughness that we derived from Landsat 8 surface reflectance and validated with on-ice measurements. Generalized additive models showed that counts of seal groups (all age classes) and pups were associated with later survey dates, deeper water, and habitat with bright Landsat 8 pixel values and intermediate pixel variability, which in turn were correlated with deep snow and surface roughness. We observed shallow snow depths, early sea-ice breakup, and high seal densities consistent with the extreme lack of ice available in 2019. Indigenous Knowledge, intentionally woven with scientific data, provided novel and more nuanced understandings of snow and sea-ice conditions for seals. Our results may give a glimpse at future ringed seal habitat and selection in a warming Arctic.},

In the present study, a method for measuring wind field by using a six-rotor UAV mounted with an ultrasonic anemometer was established, and the feasibility thereof in wind field measurement was tested. Firstly, the influence of the UAS fuselage attitude on the accuracy of wind measurement results was analysed by means of wind tunnel testing. The results show that the average wind speed obtained by the UAV anemometry system (UAS) was slightly larger, but the average wind speed obtained by the UAS was consistent with that obtained by the Cobra anemometer after the modification of the fuselage attitude coefficient. Secondly, the wind field measurement results obtained by the UAS and the wind tower were compared, and the revised wind speed, wind direction, turbulence intensity and other parameters obtained by the UAS were found to be consistent with those of the anemometers at the same height on the wind tower. The difference was within 5\%, and the longitudinal fluctuating wind power spectra obtained by the two were almost the same, being in good agreement with the Von Karman spectrum. Finally, the UAS was used to measure the wind field characteristic parameters of a certain site, which were compared with the corresponding parameters of national regulations. The feasibility of the UAS in measuring the air wind field was verified. These research results provide a reference for further research into UAV wind measurement methods.},

Besides the broad possibilities of numerical simulations, experimental data are necessary for tests of the flow conditions within a wind farm under real conditions. In wind energy and atmospheric science, a variety of measurement devices exist for measuring the wind speed. We propose a measurement system that enables completely flexible simultaneous wind measurements using a fleet of multirotor unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This approach is validated through a two-week measurement campaign at the boundary layer field site Falkenberg of the German National Meteorological Service (DWD). The wind speed is calculated from UAS motions in hover state without additional wind sensors. The measurements are calibrated and validated against sonic anemometers mounted at a 99 m mast. The capability of highly accurate spatial distributed wind measurement with an improved wind algorithm is proven by a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.25 ms−1 for the horizontal wind speed and {\textless} 5° for the wind direction. Further, turbulence measurements are presented showing valid results up to a frequency of 2 Hz in high turbulence conditions. Additionally, spatially horizontal distributed measurements with multiple UAS are examined in a case study of a gust front event.},

The typical instrument to measure fluxes of momentum and heat in the surface layer are sonic anemometers.

We present a method to obtain the three-dimensional wind vector from avionic data of small multicopter uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS). To achieve a good accuracy in both average and fluctuating parts of the wind components, calibrated motor thrusts and measured accelerations by the UAS are used. In a validation campaign, in comparison to sonic anemometers on a 99 m mast, accuracies below 0.2 m s−1 are achieved for the mean wind components and below 0.2 m2 s−2 for their variances. The spectra of variances and covariances show good agreement with the sonic anemometer up to 1 Hz temporal resolution. A case study of continuous measurements in a morning transition of a convective boundary layer with five UAS illustrates the potential of such measurements for ABL research.},

	abstract = {With the increase in the use of small uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) there is a growing need for real-time weather forecasting to improve the safety of low-altitude aircraft operations. This will require integration of measurements with autonomous systems since current available sampling lack sufficient resolution within the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Thus, the current work aims to assess the ability to measure wind speeds from a quad-copter UAS and compare the performance with that of a fixed mast. Two laboratory tests were initially performed to assess the spatial variation in the vertically induced flow from the rotors. The horizontal distribution above the rotors was examined in a water tunnel at speeds and rotation rates to simulate nominally full throttle with a relative air speed of 0 or 8 m/s. These results showed that the sensor should be placed between rotor pairs. The vertical distribution was examined from a single rotor test in a large chamber, which suggested that at full throttle the sensor should be about 400 mm above the rotor plane. Field testing was then performed with the sensor positioned in between both pairs of rotors at 406, 508, and 610 mm above the rotor plane. The mean velocity over the given period was within 5.5\% of the that measured from a fixed mast over the same period. The variation between the UAS and mast sensors were better correlated with the local mean shear than separation distance, which suggests height mismatch could be the source of error. The fluctuating velocity was quantified with the comparison of higher order statistics as well as the power spectral density, which the mast and UAS spectra were in good agreement regardless of the separation distance. This implies that for the current configuration a separation distance of 5.3 rotor diameters was sufficient to minimize the influence of the rotors.},

	abstract = {Wave propagation of electro-optical systems, lasers or imaging depends on the state of the atmosphere their beams are passing through. Fluctuations in the refractive index of air are responsible for signal attenuation and image degradation. This atmospheric effect is called optical turbulence and its strength is quantified by the structure function parameter of the refractive index 𝐶$^{\textrm{2}}$$_{\textrm{𝑛}}$ . In the atmospheric surface layer it is highly variable. Usually 𝐶$^{\textrm{2}}$$_{\textrm{𝑛}}$ decreases with height. In non-uniform terrain, big horizontal variations can arise. We developed a mobile airborne system for monitoring 𝐶$^{\textrm{2}}$$_{\textrm{𝑛}}$ to investigate the three-dimensional character of optical turbulence. Therefore the dodecacopter system HORUS (Hovering Remote controlled Ultra-light Sensor-platform (AIRCLIP /Dresden/Germany)) was chosen as mobile platform. An ultrasonic anemometer was mounted on a boom for high-resolution measurements of temperature and wind speed. Analyzing the time series of temperature, 𝐶$^{\textrm{2}}$$_{\textrm{𝑛}}$ values were derived from time averages of several minutes. The measurements took place in the surface layer over land in the vicinity of an 80 m high tower, equipped with ultrasonic anemometers at four discrete heights. Comparison measurements were performed. The minimum length of the boom outside the turbulent influence of the rotors was investigated.

	abstract = {This article presents research on a hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supported by a relative positioning system, enabling the deployment of autonomous missions from ship-based helipads in maritime conditions. A crucial issue to be solved is ensuring precise positioning of the UAV relative to the landing pad in the take-off and landing phases. To achieve this, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is implemented on the UAV's onboard computer, which integrates the positioning data from the UAV's global navigation satellite system receiver and the positioning data of the landing pad broadcast by the landing pad navigation station (LNS). The EKF estimates both the absolute and relative position of the UAV, which are required for autonomous take-off and landing on the moving landing pad. In unfavorable weather conditions, EKF also uses data from an optional local positioning system to keep the accuracy within the range 1–3 m. The research was concluded by experimental verification during a ferry cruise over the Baltic Sea. During the research, the VTOL UAV performed two fully autonomous flight missions at the range about 1 km from the moving ferry in international waters. Each of them ended with a successful landing back on the helipad with an accuracy matching its required level, which was already achieved in the previous research carried out in inland conditions. Data recorded during real flights confirm that the developed system, consisting of a hybrid VTOL UAV and a LNS, is ready to be utilized in autonomous missions at sea. Factors having a critical impact on the safety of use of the VTOL UAV in marine conditions were also identified, which were not observed during the research in inland conditions, and are related directly to turbulence around the landing pad.},

	isbn = {978-1-4684-8980-4},
	abstract = {A comprehensive laboratory study has been made on the following typical phenomena at the air-sea interface both for ordinary tap water and for water containing a soluble surfactant (NaC12H25SO4): (1) generation of wind waves; (2) wind shear stress and wind setup; and (3) growth of regular waves by the wind. The addition of the surfactant to the water shows a large suppression of the wind-generated waves, and its effect increases with increasing concentration of the surfactant within the range of our experiment. When the wind waves attenuate partially, the spectral density near the dominant frequency region shows similarity. For the maximum concentration used (2.6 x 10-2\%) wind waves are almost completely suppressed up to a wind speed U10 ≅ 15 m/s, where U10 is the wind speed at height z = 10m. For U10{\textgreater}19m/s, wind waves are generated which are similar to those on tap water. A large decrease of the wind shear stress is observed when the wind waves are suppressed almost completely by the surfactant. An empirical relation for the drag coefficient has been obtained for this case, which is slightly different from that by Van Dorn (1953). An empirical relation for the drag coefficient covering a very wide range of wind speed (U10:8–35 m/s) has also been obtained for ordinary tap water. The surface slope has been measured and related to the friction velocity of the wind. It is shown that the same relation holds for tap water and for water containing surfactant, if the friction velocities measured for the respective waters are used in the relation. The measured growth rate of the fundamental frequency component of regular waves on tap water is greater, by a factor of 2, than Miles’ (1959) growth rate, and a little greater than Snyder and colleagues’ (1981) growth rate. The growth rate of the regular waves is greatly reduced by the addition of surfactant. However, the relation between the growth rate and the friction velocity of the wind is little affected by the surfactant, because the friction velocity is diminished by the presence of surfactant.},

	abstract = {The devastating tsunami triggered by the Tōhoku-Oki earthquake of 11 March 2011 caused a crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station where it overtopped the seawall defences. On retreating, the tsunami carried loose debris and wreckage seaward and marshalled buoyant material into extensive plumes. Widespread concern over the fate of these and numerous other Tōhoku tsunami depositions prompted attempts to simulate debris dispersion throughout the wider Pacific. However, the effects of locally perturbed wind and wave fields, active Langmuir circulation and current-induced attrition determine a complex and poorly understood morphology for large floating agglomerations. Here we show that the early post-tsunami evolution of marine-debris plumes near Fukushima Daiichi was also shaped by near-surface wind modifications that took place above relatively calm (lower surface roughness) waters covered by surface films derived from oil and other contaminants. High-spatial-resolution satellite tracking reveals faster-than-expected floating-debris motions and invigorated plume evolution within these regions, while numerical modelling of turbulent air flow over the low-drag, film-covered surface predicts typically metre-per-second wind strengthening at centimetric heights, sufficient to explain the observed debris-speed increases. Wind restructuring probably stimulates the dispersion of flotsam from both biological and anthropogenic sources throughout a global ocean of highly variable surface roughness.},

	abstract = {We review the characteristics of sea level variability at the coast focussing on how it differs from the variability in the nearby deep ocean. Sea level variability occurs on all timescales, with processes at higher frequencies tending to have a larger magnitude at the coast due to resonance and other dynamics. In the case of some processes, such as the tides, the presence of the coast and the shallow waters of the shelves results in the processes being considerably more complex than offshore. However, ‘coastal variability’ should not always be considered as ‘short spatial scale variability’ but can be the result of signals transmitted along the coast from 1000s km away. Fortunately, thanks to tide gauges being necessarily located at the coast, many aspects of coastal sea level variability can be claimed to be better understood than those in the deep ocean. Nevertheless, certain aspects of coastal variability remain under-researched, including how changes in some processes (e.g., wave setup, river runoff) may have contributed to the historical mean sea level records obtained from tide gauges which are now used routinely in large-scale climate research.},

The method is adaptable to any coastal region in the world where surface data are available. Specific prediction guidelines have been developed using Portsmouth, New Hampshire, as the forecast site. Using Portsmouth METARs (translated roughly from the French as aviation routine weather report), 167 days were determined to have conditions favorable for the occurrence of a sea breeze. Each of these 167 days are classified as either sea-breeze, marginal, or non-sea-breeze events. Sea breezes were defined as insolation-driven local onshore winds. Marginal events were weak sea breezes. Non-sea-breeze events were those days on which sufficient insolation was present but failed to produce a sea breeze at Portsmouth. The surface analyses for these 167 days were used to define a set of synoptic classes based on the arrangement of large-scale pressure systems, and meaningful interpretations resulted. For example, sea breezes and marginals account for almost 80\% of one class, whereas two other classes produced no sea-breeze events. Standard surface observations were used to calculate the “regional scale” cross-shore potential temperature gradient (δθ/δx) and the cross-shore geostrophic wind component (uG) for the hour of onset (sea breeze and marginal events) or of peak heating (non-sea-breeze events). Stronger negative δθ/δx values were needed to develop a sea breeze in the presence of stronger positive uG values. The six well-defined synoptic classes were plotted as a function of δθ/δx and uG and occupy specific regions of the resulting diagram.},

	abstract = {A shallow, stable boundary layer is ubiquitous over the cool waters of the Gulf of Maine in summer. This layer affects pollutant transport throughout the region by isolating overlying flow from the surface. In this paper, we explore how the stable boundary layer is formed and describe its characteristics. The temperature profile of the lowest 1–2 km of the atmosphere over the Gulf of Maine is remarkably similar regardless of transport time over water or the time of day when the flow left the land, provided only that the flow is offshore. This similarity is forced by the (roughly) constant water temperature and the (roughly) constant temperature of the free troposphere over the continent. However, the processes leading to the similar profiles are quite different depending on the time of day when the flow crosses the coast. Air leaving the coast at night already has a stable profile, whereas air leaving the coast at midday or afternoon has a deep mixed layer. In the latter case, the stable layer formation over the water is of interest. Using observations of surface fluxes, profiles, and winds on the NOAA Research Vessel Ronald H. Brown from the 2004 International Consortium for Atmospheric Research in Transport and Transformation (ICARTT)/New England Air Quality Study, we show that the formation of the stable layer, which involves cooling a roughly 50- to 100-m-deep layer by 5–15 K, occurs within 10 km and a half hour after leaving the coast. The internal boundary layer near shore is deeper than predicted by standard relationships. Historical data are explored and also show deeper internal boundary layers than predicted. We also describe one exceptional case where a 200-m-deep neutral layer was observed and discuss the degree of isolation of the stable boundary layer and its duration.},

Munk developed an empirical model of the slope distribution of ocean surface waves that has been widely used ever since to model the optical properties of the sea surface and is of particular importance to the satellite remote sensing community. In that work, the reflectance of sunlight was photographed from a Boeing B-17G bomber and was then analyzed. In this paper, surface slope statistics are investigated from airborne scanning topographic lidar data collected during a series of field experiments off the coast of California and in the Gulf of Mexico, over a broad range of environmental conditions, with wind speeds ranging from approximately 2 to 13 m s−1. Unlike the reflectance-based approach of Cox and Munk, the slope distribution is computed by counting laser glints produced by specular reflections as the lidar is scanned over the surface of the ocean. We find good agreement with their measurements for the mean-square slope and with more recent (2006) results from Bréon and Henriot that were based on satellite remote sensing. Significant discrepancies for the higher-order statistics are found and discussed. We also demonstrate here that airborne scanning lidar technology offers a viable means of remotely estimating surface wind speed and momentum flux.},

However, research on field trips to science museums has predominantly explored teachers' and students' perspectives with little acknowledgment of the museum educators who develop and implement the educational programs the students experience. This study sought to describe instruction undertaken in, and goals driving, science museums' lessons through observations of museum educators followed by conversations with them immediately afterwards. Findings showed the ways in which educators adapted their preplanned lessons to the students' interests, needs, and understanding by manipulating the sequence and timing. The data revealed that, contrary to depictions in the research literature of teaching in museums as didactic and lecture oriented, there was creativity, complexity, and skills involved in teaching science in museums. Finally, the educators' teaching actions were predominantly influenced by their affective goals to nurture interests in science and learning. Although their lessons were ephemeral experiences, these educators operated from a perspective, which regarded a school field trip to the science museum, not as a one-time event, but as part of a continuum of visiting such institutions well beyond school and childhood. These findings have implications for the pedagogical practices employed by museum educators, and the relationship between teachers and educators during school field trips, which are discussed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our retrospective analysis of student learning from five exhibits suggests certain pedagogical and facilitation strategies in three specific areas: first, the sensory-motor experience promotes students’ understanding of the scientific principle of the exhibit. Second, exhibits should aim at presenting abstract concepts in a tangible way. Third, museum educators should use anchor-points throughout the visit to create a more cohesive ‘story’ for students, so that they relate to it in a way, which will help them remember the experience over time. Consequently, the main implications of this study concern exhibit design and the overall pedagogy of the visit.},

	abstract = {Surface gravity waves generated by winds are ubiquitous on our oceans and play a primordial role in the dynamics of the ocean–land–atmosphere interfaces. In particular, wind-generated waves cause fluctuations of the sea level at the coast over timescales from a few seconds (individual wave runup) to a few hours (wave-induced setup). These wave-induced processes are of major importance for coastal management as they add up to tides and atmospheric surges during storm events and enhance coastal flooding and erosion. Changes in the atmospheric circulation associated with natural climate cycles or caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions affect the wave conditions worldwide, which may drive significant changes in the wave-induced coastal hydrodynamics. Since sea-level rise represents a major challenge for sustainable coastal management, particularly in low-lying coastal areas and/or along densely urbanized coastlines, understanding the contribution of wind-generated waves to the long-term budget of coastal sea-level changes is therefore of major importance. In this review, we describe the physical processes by which sea states may affect coastal sea level at several timescales, we present the methods currently used to estimate the wave contribution to coastal sea-level changes, we describe past and future wave climate variability, we discuss the contribution of wave to coastal sea-level changes, and we discuss the limitations and perspectives of this research field.},

At observed wind speeds of 4–12 ms−1, wave mean square slopes are positively correlated with wind speed. Wave-relative surface currents varied significantly, from opposing the wave direction at 0.24 ms−1 to following the waves at 0.47 ms−1. Wave slopes are 5\%–10\% higher when surface currents oppose the waves compared to when currents strongly follow the waves, consistent with a conservation of wave energy flux across gradients in currents. Assuming an equilibrium frequency range in the wave spectrum, wave slope is proportional to wind friction velocity and momentum flux. The observed variation in wave slope equates to a 10\%–20\% variation in momentum flux over the range of observed wind speeds (4–12 ms−1), with larger variations at higher winds. At wind speeds over 8 ms−1, momentum flux varies by at least 6\% more than the variation expected from current-relative winds alone, and suggests that wave-current interactions can generate significant spatial and temporal variability in momentum fluxes in this region of prevailing trade winds.

In this study, a third generation wave model, WAVEWATCH III, has been incorporated as a component of the Community Earth System Model, version 1.2 (CESM1.2). In particular, the wave model is now coupled with the ocean model through a modified version of the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) to approximate the influence of Langmuir mixing.

Ventilation is enhanced and low concentration biases of pCFC-11 are reduced in the Southern Hemisphere. A majority of the improvements persist in the presence of other climate feedbacks in the fully coupled experiments.

The depth-integrated wave–current models developed by Yang \& Liu (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 883, 2020, A4) are extended to investigate currents with an arbitrary vertical profile in the water column. In the present models, horizontal velocities are decomposed into two components. The first part deduces the prescribed current velocity when waves are absent. The second part is approximated in a polynomial form. The resulting depth-integrated wave–current models are obtained by applying the weighted residual method. In the absence of currents, the present models are identical to those in Yang \& Liu (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 883, 2020, A4) and are validated with several three-dimensional (3D) benchmark laboratory experiments. A theoretical analysis is conducted to study the frequency dispersion relation of linear waves on currents with an exponential vertical profile and the results are compared with numerical solutions of the Rayleigh equation. Using the new models, validations and investigations are then conducted for periodic waves and solitary waves on currents with an arbitrary profile in one-dimensional horizontal (1DH) space. Furthermore, the new models are applied to wave–current interactions in two-dimensional horizontal (2DH) space. Two scenarios are considered: (1) wave propagation over a vortex-ring-like current and (2) obliquely incident wave propagation over a 3D sheared current on a varying bathymetry. The vertical and horizontal shear of the current have significant effects on modifying various wave properties, which are well captured by the present models. However, the time-averaged velocity under wave–current interaction shows small differences with the prescribed current velocity, except in the region between the wave trough and crest.},

Consequently, existing drag coefficient parameterizations, which were largely developed in deep water, are not effective. This has an adverse impact on marine forecasts, weather and climate models, and coastal morphology prediction. There exists a critical need to identify and systematically quantify the impact of coastal processes and features on the momentum flux over a wide range of wind speeds. As part of the DUring Nearshore Event eXperiment at the Field Research Facility in Duck, NC, six months of direct flux observations were collected from a tower at the end of a 560 m pier. These were used to study the variability of the aerodynamic drag coefficient. Results show that for winds above 3 m s−1 the drag coefficient was between 15\% and 50\% higher for onshore winds when compared to alongshore. This is attributed to more energy in the downwind component of the flux around the dominant wave frequency for onshore winds, and is independent of wind speed. Holistically, the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) algorithm over predicts the drag coefficient for shoaling waves. When separated by wind direction, COARE best predicts the drag coefficient for onshore winds. The results of this study can help the development of more robust nearshore momentum flux parameterizations. This will ultimately lead to improved weather and climate forecasting in the littoral zone, and more physically realistic short- and long-term coastal resilience strategies.},

First, we describe a framework for evaluating the vertically integrated turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equation using measurable quantities from a surface mooring, showing the connection to the atmospheric, mean oceanic, and wave energy. Second, we use this framework to evaluate turbulent energetics in the mixed layer using 10 months of mooring data.

	abstract = {Data from five recent field campaigns are selected for pure wind sea, deep water, and fully rough flow conditions. The combined data set includes a wide range of wave ages, with high variability in both friction velocity and wave phase speed. These data, which are expected to follow Monin-Obukhov similarity scaling, are used to investigate the influence of wave age on wind stress. The relationship between the dimensionless roughness and inverse wave age is found to be zo/σ = 13.4 (u*/cp)3.4, where zo is the surface roughness length, σ is the standard deviation of the surface elevation, u* is the friction velocity, and cp is the wave phase speed at the peak of the spectrum. This relationship, which represents a significant dependence of roughness on wave age, was obtained using a procedure that minimizes the effects of spurious correlation in u*. It is also shown to be consistent with the wave age relationship derived using an alternate form of the dimensionless roughness, namely, the Charnock parameter zog/u*2, where g is the gravitational constant.},

	abstract = {Accurate and cost-effective sea state measurements, in terms of spatio-temporal distribution of water surface elevation (water waves), is of great interest for scientific research and various engineering, industrial, and recreational applications. To this end, numerous measurement techniques have been developed over the years. None of these techniques, however, are universally applicable across various ocean and laboratory conditions and none provide near-real-time data. We utilized the latest advances in polarimetric imaging to develop a new remote sensing method based on machine learning methodology and polarimetric reflection measurements for inferring surface waves elevation and slope. The method utilizes a newly available, inexpensive polarimetric camera providing images of the water surface in a high spatio-temporal resolution at several linear polarization angles. Algorithms based on artificial neural networks (s) are then trained to obtain high-resolution reconstructions of the water surface slope state from those images. The s are trained on laboratory-collected supervised datasets of prescribed mechanically generated monochromatic wave trains and tested on a stochastic wave field of JONSWAP spectral shape. The proposed method, based on inferring the surface slope from polarimetric images, provides a dense estimate of the water surface. The results of this study pave the way for the development of accurate and cost-effective near-real-time remote sensing tools for both laboratory and open sea wave measurements.},

Lab format and data-collection mode showed an interaction, such that for the hands-on lab format learning outcomes were higher when the lab team collected data sets working as a group rather than individually collecting data sets to be combined later, while for remotely-operated labs individual data collection was best. The pattern of time spent on various lab-related activities suggests that working with real instead of simulated data may induce higher levels of motivation.

We conducted high-resolution observations of fluorescent-DOM (FDOM) at 13 stations in the coastal and open Atlantic Ocean to understand the enrichment processes. Results show that FDOM enrichment in the SML varied between 0.8 and 2.0 (in comparison to the concentrations in the underlying water; ULW), and FDOM enrichment is a common feature of the SML despite the varied distances to the terrestrial sources. At six stations, the FDOM concentration in the SML was less variable over the sampling period ({\textgreater}5 h) compared to FDOM concentrations in the ULW characterized with sudden changes. Even so we observed slightly lower enrichments with increasing wind speeds and solar radiation, changes in ULW concentrations forced the enrichment to change. In addition, we found evidences for the occurrence of photochemical degradation of FDOM in near-shore SML with implications on coastal carbon cycling. Overall, the results show that the processes leading to the enrichment of DOM in the SML are more complex than previously assumed. Given the importance of the organic-rich SML as a diffusion layer in the air–sea exchange of climate-relevant gases and heat, understanding the layer’s enrichment processes is crucial.},

New, experimentally-derived threshold values at which primary production acts as a significant source of natural surfactants to the microlayer are coupled with a wind speed threshold at which the SML is presumed to be disrupted, and the results suggest that surfactant enrichment in the SML is greater in oligotrophic regions of the ocean than in more productive waters. Furthermore, surfactant enrichments persisted at wind speeds of up to 10 m s−1, without any observed depletion above 5 m s−1. This suggests that the SML is stable enough to exist even at the global average wind speed of 6.6 m s−1. Using our observations of the surfactant enrichments at various trophic levels and wind states, global maps of primary production and wind speed allow us to extrapolate the ocean's SML coverage . The maps indicate that wide regions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans between 30° N and 30° S may be more significantly covered with SML than north of 30° N and south of 30° S, where higher productivity (spring/summer blooms) and wind speeds exceeding 12 m s−1 may prevent extensive SML formation.},

The mechanisms relating OM to GER remain unclear, but may involve mechanical (rheological) damping of turbulence in the water immediately below the surface microlayer, damping of ripples and blocking of molecular diffusion by layers of OM, as well as electrical effects. To help guide future research in GER, particularly of CO2, we review published rheological properties of ocean water and cultures of phytoplankton and bacteria in both 3D and 2D deformation geometries, in water from both the surface layer and underlying water. Production of foam modulates air-sea exchange of many properties and substances, perhaps including climate-changing gases such as CO2. We thus also review biological modulation of production and decay of whitecaps and other sea foam. In the ocean literature on biological production of OM, particularly that which associates with the sea surface, the terms “surfactant” and “surface-active” have been given a variety of meanings that are sometimes vague, and may confuse. We therefore propose a more restricted definition of these terms in line with usage in surface science and organic chemistry.

	abstract = {The air side of the water‐air interface is the most hydrophobic surface known. In quantitative terms the water‐air interface is about 30\% more hydrophobic than the surfaces of nonpolar condensed‐phase compounds or materials such as octane or Teflon. The hyperhydrophobicity of the air side of the water‐air interface is the main cause of the large increase in contact angle of drops of water deposited upon rough surfaces of apolar materials, as compared with the water contact angle on smooth surfaces of the same materials. A water drop supported on a very porous fractal surface, encountering only about 1\% solid support and 99\% air, can reach a contact angle of 174°, which is exceedingly close to the (albeit unattainable) maximum of 180°. The water‐air interface hydrophobically attracts completely apolar molecules, as well as the apolar side of amphiphilic molecules (such as surfactants). Thus, for instance, dissolved surfactant molecules aggregate at a high concentration at the water‐air interface when dissolved in water. On the other hand, the water‐air interface repels dissolved hydrophilic (or near‐hydrophilic) solutes, such as sugars and polysaccharides, mainly via net repulsive van der Waals forces. Thus, the water‐air interface is depleted of such hydrophilic (or near‐hydrophilic) solutes, leaving a significantly higher concentration of these solutes in the bulk of the aqueous medium than at its air interface. As both of these contrasting phenomena result in strongly anisotropic concentration distributions in liquid drops and as contact angle determinations depend on a known and homogeneous free energy of cohesion of the liquid throughout the drop, one should never measure contact angles on solid surfaces for the purpose of measuring their surface thermodynamic properties by using aqueous solutions, mixtures, or solutions in or mixtures of other polar or partly polar liquids. Finally, the peculiar properties of the water‐air interface give rise to what at first sight appears to be paradoxical behavior of air bubbles in water: in pure deionized water, air bubbles attract one another and coalesce. On the other hand, upon the addition of salt (e.g., NaCl), air bubbles repel each other and thus do not coalesce, all in apparent contradiction of the classical rules governing the stability or instability of colloidal suspensions in water.},

As the boundary layer between the ocean and the atmosphere, the SML covers 70\% of Earth. The remote-controlled Sea Surface Scanner is based on a glass disk sampler to automate the sampling of the thin SML, overcoming the disadvantages of techniques such as low volume sampling and ex situ measurement of the SML. A suite of in situ sensors for seven biogeochemical parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, chromophoric dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll-a, and photosynthetic efficiency) was implemented to characterize the SML in reference to the mixed bulk water. The Sea Surface Scanner has the capability to collect 24 discrete water samples with a volume of 1 L each for further laboratory analysis. Meteorological parameters such as wind speed influence SML properties and are continuously monitored. This paper reports the use of the Sea Surface Scanner to identify and study (i) upwelling regions and associated fronts, (ii) rain events, and (iii) the occurrence of surface blooms. The high patchiness of the SML was detected during the observed sea surface phenomena, and high-resolution mapping of the biogeochemical parameters of the oceanic boundary layer to the atmosphere are presented for the first time. The Sea Surface Scanner is a new technology to map and understand sea surface processes and, ultimately, to fill the gaps in knowledge about ocean–atmosphere interactions relevant to ocean and climate science.},

	abstract = {Surfactants, or surface-active substances (SAS), are amphipathic organic substances that adsorb on aquatic phase boundaries, including the air-sea interface that covers {\textasciitilde}70\% of Earth's surface. SAS thus mediate all mass transfer across the air-sea interface and are central to planetary scale biogeochemical processes. SAS are routinely quantified in seawater and freshwater in terms of total surfactant activity (SA), using alternating current (AC) out-of-phase voltammetry with a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE). Although this technique is well established, method modifications have been implemented and differing calibration procedures adopted in individual research laboratories. Increasing interest in the environmental roles of SAS prompts a timely inter-comparison of these varying analytical approaches. Using sea-surface microlayer (SML: uppermost 80 μm layer sampled) and sub-surface (SSW: 1 m depth sampled) seawater from Jade Bay (south-eastern North Sea), we carried out the first inter-laboratory comparison for SA, using methods and calibration protocols previously established in three participating laboratories. The internal calibration protocol follows direct calibrations of individual samples against the model surfactant Triton-X-100 during analysis, whereas external calibration produces independent Triton-X-100 calibration curves; both protocols express SAS concentrations in Triton-X-100 equivalents (T-X-100 eq.). There was no significant difference between SA derived via internal or external calibration protocols, or by using different analytical instruments (range in Kruskall-Wallis and Dunn-Bonferroni post-hoc test p-values: 0.062–1.000), except where freeze/thaw degradation was suspected to have occurred during transit (p {\textless} .001). We recommend using discrete calibration standards during external calibration. Irrespective of any differences in SA determined by the three laboratories, the SA enrichment factor (EF: =SASML/SASSW) was not affected for any sample; the root mean square error (±one standard deviation) between all laboratories was 0.156 ± 0. 226 (n = 45). We present and discuss recommendations for a standard analytical protocol to ensure the inter-laboratory compatibility of SAS measurements into the future.},

Using the Beer-Lambert Law, light attenuation measurements were used to calculate the thickness of adsorbed solution layers on a rotating glass disk with and without salt and surfactants. The observations have shown that the adsorbed film thickness can vary between 80 and 40 µm for glass rotation speeds between 4 and 16 cm s−1, depending on salinity and surfactant concentrations. For example, the thickness of a film of water with 40 ppt of salt and 5 cm s−1 rotation speed was in the range of 80 µm. The adsorbed layer thickness increases with increasing salt concentration and with increasing concentrations of surface active substances. These results are comparable to results obtained by vertically dipping a glass plate and determining film thickness from the collected volume of water. Because the glass disk rotational speed significantly influences the thickness of the adsorbed solution layer, it is important that the speed is maintained at a value for which the adsorbed thickness has been calibrated. At typical oceanic salinities, the dependence of the adsorbed film thickness on rotation speed was limited. However, even small changes in surface active substances resulted in significant thickness changes.},

Although DOM has been the focus of several decades of active research in marine chemistry, fundamental questions about its sources, composition, and reactivity remain. Sea salt aerosols produced at the ocean surface will incorporate some of the photochemically-active organic materials concentrated in the sea surface microlayer, including CDOM. There have been very limited studies on photochemistry in aerosol particles, but likely reactions and yields can be conjectured. The photochemistry of the sea surface micro-layer and marine aerosol particles constitutes an important new area of research for marine photochemists.},

	doi = {10.1098/rspa.2019.0763},
	abstract = {For decades, the effect of surfactants in the sea-surface microlayer (SML) on gas transfer velocity (k) has been recognized; however, it has not been quantified under natural conditions due to missing coherent data on in situ k of carbon dioxide (CO2) and characterization of the SML. Moreover, a sea-surface phenomenon of wave-dampening, known as slicks, has been observed frequently in the ocean and potentially reduces the transfer of climate-relevant gases between the ocean and atmosphere. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the effect of natural surfactant and slicks on the in situ k of CO2. A catamaran, Sea Surface Scanner (S3), was deployed to sample the SML and corresponding underlying water, and a drifting buoy with a floating chamber was deployed to measure the in situ k of CO2. We found a significant 23\% reduction of k above surfactant concentrations of 200 µg Teq l−1, which were common in the SML except for the Western Pacific. We conclude that an error of approximately 20\% in CO2 fluxes for the Western Pacific is induced by applying wind-based parametrization not developed in low surfactant regimes. Furthermore, we observed an additional 62\% reduction in natural slicks, reducing global CO2 fluxes by 19\% considering known frequency of slick coverage. From our observation, we identified surfactant concentrations with two different end-members which lead to an error in global CO2 flux estimation if ignored.},

The average Lagrangian is calculated from the Stokes expansion for periodic wave trains in water of arbitrary depth. This Lagrangian can be used for the various applications described in the above reference. In this paper, the crucial question of the ‘type’ of the differential equations for the wave-train parameters (local amplitude, wave-number, etc.) is established. The equations are hyperbolic or elliptic according to whether kh0 is less than or greater than 1.36, where k is the wave-number per 2π and h0 is the undisturbed depth. In the hyperbolic case, changes in the wave train propagate and the characteristic velocities give generalizations of the linear group velocity. In the elliptic case, modulations in the wave train grow exponentially and a periodic wave train will be unstable in this sense; thus, periodic wave trains on water will be unstable if kh0 {\textgreater} 1·36, The instability of deep-water waves, kh0 {\textgreater} 1·36, was discovered in a different way by Benjamin (1966). The relation between the two approaches is explained.},

The relationship between DoLP and the c/a ratio is investigated for the upwelling polarized light field for a complete set of viewing geometries, at several wavelengths in the visible part of the spectrum; for varying compositions of the aquatic environment, whose constituents include phytoplankton, non-algal particles, and color dissolved organic matter (CDOM); and for varying microphysical properties such as the refractive index and the slope of the Junge-type particle size distribution (PSD).

	abstract = {Ocean wave heights are typically measured at select geographic locations using in situ ocean buoys. This dissertation has developed a technique to remotely measure wave heights using imagery collected from a polarimetric camera system mounted on an airborne platform, enabling measurements over large areas and in regions devoid of wave buoys. The technique exploits the polarization properties of Fresnel reflectivity at the ocean surface to calculate wave slopes. Integrating the slope field produces a measurement of significant wave height. In this dissertation, I present experimental data collection and analysis of airborne remotely sensed polarimetric imagery collected over the ocean using Areté Associates' Airborne Remote Optical Spotlight System-MultiSpectral Polarimeter, as well as modeled results of the expected radiance and polarization at the sensor. The modeling incorporates two sources of radiance/polarization: surface reflected sky radiance and scattered path radiance. The latter accounts for a significant portion of the total radiance and strongly affects the polarization state measured at the sensor. After laying the groundwork, I describe my significant wave height retrieval algorithm, apply it to the polarimetric data, and present the results. While further development and refinement of the significant wave height retrieval algorithm and testing with a more extensive data set are required, the initial results are promising for the practical application of this technique.},

However, these systems acquire the polarization measurements through spatial modulation and each measurement has a varying instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV). When these measurements are combined to estimate the polarization images, strong edge artifacts are present that severely degrade the estimated polarization imagery. These artifacts can be reduced when interpolation strategies are first applied to the intensity data prior to Stokes vector estimation. Here we formally study IFOV error and the performance of several bilinear interpolation strategies used for reducing it.},

The reflection model used is the Torrance-Sparrow model assuming combined specular and diffuse reflection. The specular and diffuse reflection components have distinct polarization states which makes it possible to resolve intersecting specular and diffuse equireflection curves in gradient space thereby measuring surface orientation. The light source incident orientation and the viewer orientation are assumed to be known along with the complex index of refraction of the material surface and the root mean square slope of planar microfacets characterizing surface roughness. The theoretical development is very comprehensive with respect to the nature of the incident and reflected light radiation which is assumed to be quasi-monochromatic having arbitrary degree of polarization. Thus determination of surface orientation is feasible using incident incoherent natural sunlight which is completely unpolarized, using incident partially polarized light such as specularly reflected natural sunlight, or using completely polarized incident light such as light which is elliptically polarized including circular and linear polarizations.},

A two-scale method of sea surface realization and the inverse ray tracing of light transfer calculation are combined and executed simultaneously, decreasing the consumption of time and memory dramatically. Then the scattering process that the infrared light emits from the sea surface and propagates in the aerosol particles is simulated with a polarized light Monte Carlo model. Transformations of the polarization state of the light are calculated with the Mie theory. Finally, the polarimetric infrared images of the sea surface of different environmental conditions and detection parameters are generated based on the scattered light detected by the infrared imaging polarimeter. The results of simulation examples show that our polarimetric infrared imaging simulation can be applied to predict the infrared polarization characteristics of the sea surface, model the oceanic scene, and guide the detection in the oceanic environment.},

The semi-empirical Rayleigh model is used to analyze the polarization of scattered skylight; the Harrison and Coombes model is used to analyze light radiance distribution; and the Cox-Munk model and Mueller matrix are used to analyze reflections from wave surface. First, we calculate the polarization patterns and intensity distribution of light reflected off wave surface. Then we investigate their relationship with incident radiation, solar zenith angle, wind speed and wind direction. Our results show that the polarization patterns of reflected skylight from waves and flat water are different, while skylight reflected on both kinds of water is generally highly polarized at the Brewster angle and the polarization direction is approximately parallel to the water's surface. The backward-reflecting Brewster zone has a relatively low reflectance and a high DOP in all observing directions. This can be used to optimally diminish the reflected skylight and avoid sunglint in ocean optics measurements.},

Nonlinear wave profiles are realized accounting for a wide range of climatologically relevant sea states and wind speeds. Polarized ray tracing is used to investigate air-incident and whitecap-free reflectance and transmittance distributions with high angular resolution subject to sea-characterizing parameters, such as significant wave height, peak wave period, wind speed, and surface roughness. Wave-shadowing effects of incident and multiple reflected rays are fully considered. Their influence mostly starts with incidence angles greater than 60°, i.e., when the sun is near the horizon, and is especially pronounced for steep sea states. The net effect of multiple reflections is a redistribution of reflectance and transmittance fractions in their respective hemispheres and a slight increase of the net transmission of light into the sea. Revised reflectance and transmittance distribution functions, RDF and TDF, are provided depending on surface roughness in terms of the mean-square slope; reference is made to other sea state parameters. In comparison with the slope statistics approach, uncertainties related to sun near the horizon are reduced and on average this study yields somewhat higher reflectance values with some variability related to the sea state. By means of provided data, irradiance and radiance reflectances can be computed using desired sky radiance distributions, e.g., clear sky, overcast or partly cloudy sky, as well as wind or sea state information including wave propagation direction.},

	abstract = {Abstract In winter, the Northwest Tropical Atlantic Ocean can be characterized by various wave age-based interactions among ocean current, surface wind and surface waves, which are critical for accurately describing surface wind stress. In this work, coupled wave-ocean-atmosphere model simulations are conducted using two different wave roughness parameterizations within COARE3.5, including one that relies solely on wind speed and another that uses wave age and wave slope as inputs. Comparisons with the directly measured momentum fluxes during the ATOMIC/EUREC4A experiments in winter 2020 show that, for sea states dominated by short wind waves under moderate to strong winds, the wave-based formulation (WBF) increases the surface roughness length in average by 25\% compared to the wind-speed-based approach. For sea states dominated by remotely generated swells under moderate to strong wind intensity, the WBF predicts significantly lower roughness length and surface stress (≈15\%), resulting in increased near-surface wind speed above the constant flux layer (≈5\%). Further investigation of the mixed sea states in the model and data indicates that the impact of swell on wind stress is over-emphasized in the COARE3.5 WBF, especially under moderate wind regimes. Various approaches are explored to alleviate this deficiency by either introducing directional alignment between wind and waves or using the mean wave period instead of the wave period corresponding to the spectral peak to compute the wave age. The findings of this study are likely to be site-dependent, and mostly concern specific regimes of wind and waves where the original parameterization was deficient.},

	abstract = {Abstract Surface waves grow through a mechanism in which atmospheric pressure is offset in phase from the wavy surface. A pattern of low atmospheric pressure over upward wave orbital motions (leeward side) and high pressure over downward wave orbital motions (windward side) travels with the water wave, leading to a pumping of kinetic energy from the atmospheric boundary layer into the waves. This pressure pattern persists above the air/water interface, modifying the turbulent kinetic energy in the atmospheric wave-affected boundary layer. Here, we present field measurements of wave-coherent atmospheric pressure and velocity to elucidate the transfer of energy from the atmospheric turbulence budget into waves through wave-coherent atmospheric pressure work. Measurements show that the phase between wave-coherent pressure and velocity is shifted slightly above 90° when wind speed exceeds the wave phase speed, allowing for a downwards energy flux via pressure work. Although previous studies have reported wave-coherent pressure, to the authors’ knowledge, these are the first reported field measurements of wave-coherent pressure work. Measured pressure work cospectra are consistent with an existing model for atmospheric pressure work. The implications for these measurements and their importance to the turbulent kinetic energy budget are discussed.},

Recent advances in nanofabrication have enabled the practical manufacture of DoFP sensors for the visible spectrum. These sensors are made by integrating nanowire polarization filters directly with an imaging array, and size variations of the nanowires due to fabrication can cause the optical properties of the filters to vary up to 20\% across the imaging array. If left unchecked, these variations introduce significant errors when reconstructing the polarization image. Calibration methods offer a means to correct these errors. This work evaluates a scalar and matrix calibration derived from a mathematical model of the polarimeter behavior. The methods are evaluated quantitatively with an existing DoFP polarimeter under varying illumination intensity and angle of linear polarization.},

	abstract = {Recent interest in the utility of polarimetry for military and commercial applications has led to the development of many different imaging polarimetric systems. Much of the attention has focused on time-sequential acquisition systems. These systems use a rotating retarder or polarizer with data acquisition times that range anywhere from 10 to 100 seconds. This length of time is needed to capture the required frames of data used to construct a polarimetric image. Consequently, scene changes during data collection will either induce false polarization effects or induce mis- registration effects. These can occur in scenes where the target, background or sky is changing intensity rapidly or in cases where the target or sensor is in motion. To overcome these limitations SY Technology Inc. is developing and testing a 4 camera polarimetric imaging system capable of simultaneously capturing the needed frames to produce a full-stokes polarimetric image. The system operates in the visible to near IR spectrum and is capable of a 25Hz Stokes image frame rate. This paper will summarize the design, components and calibration of a 4 camera polarimetric system.},

	abstract = {Long-wave infrared imaging Stokes vector polarimeters are used in many remote sensing applications. Imaging polarimeters require that several measurements be made under optically different conditions in order to estimate the polarization signature at a given scene point. This multiple-measurement requirement introduces error in the signature estimates, and the errors differ depending upon the type of measurement scheme used. Here, we investigate a LWIR linear microgrid polarimeter. This type of instrument consists of a mosaic of micropolarizers at different orientations that are masked directly onto a focal plane array sensor. In this scheme, each polarization measurement is acquired spatially and hence each is made at a different point in the scene. This is a significant source of error, as it violates the requirement that each polarization measurement have the same instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV). In this paper, we first study the amount of error introduced by the IFOV handicap in microgrid instruments. We then proceed to investigate means for mitigating the effects of these errors to improve the quality of polarimetric imagery. In particular, we examine different interpolation schemes and gauge their performance. These studies are completed through the use of both real instrumental and modeled data.},

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using visible-light polarization imaging to observe submarine wakes. The key links in the imagine chain are considered separately. These include the polarization patterns of skylight, the elevations and slopes of submarine wakes and sea waves, and the changes in the sea surface polarized bidirectional reflectance characteristics due to modulation of gravity–capillary waves by the wake’s velocity field. A complete model of the airborne optical polarization imaging process is constructed and images are simulated via ray tracing. All theories proposed are verified by a series of terrestrial observation experiments. The results show that both the sea surface roughness modulation by the wake’s velocity field and the sea surface slope formed by wake elevation play significant roles in the imaging process. The wake features in the Stokes vector linear polarization component (Q, U) images are effectively enhanced, and the environmental adverse effect on these images is smaller than that on the intensity images. The degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and angle of polarization (AoP) images exhibit acceptable contrast under certain zenith and azimuth angles. Thus, our analysis confirms that airborne optical polarization imaging has considerable potential for observing wakes and other small- and medium-scale ocean dynamic processes.},

Links Historical Developments to Current Applications and Future Innovations

This book starts with a general description of light and continues with a complete exploration of polarized light, including how it is produced and its practical applications. The author incorporates basic topics, such as polarization by refraction and reflection, polarization elements, anisotropic materials, polarization formalisms (Mueller–Stokes and Jones) and associated mathematics, and polarimetry, or the science of polarization measurement.

New to the Third Edition:


A new introductory chapter 


Chapters on: polarized light in nature, and form birefringence


A review of the history of polarized light, and a chapter on the interference laws of Fresnel and Arago—both completely re-written


A new appendix on conventions used in polarized light


New graphics, and black-and-white photos and color plates


Divided into four parts, this book covers the fundamental concepts and theoretical framework of polarized light. Next, it thoroughly explores the science of polarimetry, followed by discussion of polarized light applications. The author concludes by discussing how our polarized light framework is applied to physics concepts, such as accelerating charges and quantum systems. 

Building on the solid foundation of the first two editions, this book reorganizes and updates existing material on fundamentals, theory, polarimetry, and applications. It adds new chapters, graphics, and color photos, as well as a new appendix on conventions used in polarized light. As a result, the author has re-established this book’s lofty status in the pantheon of literature on this important field.},

Such filter arrays work as the Bayer pattern for colour cameras, sharing similar advantages and drawbacks. Among the others, the raw image must be demosaiced considering the local variations of the PFA and the characteristics of the imaged scene. Non-linear effects, like the cross-talk among neighbouring pixels, are difficult to explicitly model and suggest the potential advantage of a data-driven learning approach. However, the PFA cannot be removed from the sensor, making it difficult to acquire the ground-truth polarization state for training. In this work we propose a novel CNN-based model which directly demosaics the raw camera image to a per-pixel Stokes vector. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a network architecture composed by a sequence of Mosaiced Convolutions operating coherently with the local arrangement of the different filters. Second, we introduce a new method, employing a consumer LCD screen, to effectively acquire real-world data for training. The process is designed to be invariant by monitor gamma and external lighting conditions. We extensively compared our method against algorithmic and learning-based demosaicing techniques, obtaining a consistently lower error especially in terms of polarisation angle.},

To interpret such phenomena, an improved approach was derived based on the fact that the total wind stress was the vector sum of turbulent stress and wave-coherent stress. Different from the approaches of earlier studies, our approach did not align the turbulent stress with the mean wind speed. The influence of swell waves on the magnitude and direction of the total wind stress was analyzed using our approach. The results showed that the wave-coherent stress derived from our data accounted for 32\% of the total wind stress. The magnitude and angle of the wind stress changed by swell waves depended on the relative angle between the turbulent stress and swell direction.},

	abstract = {Ocean Literacy (OL) has multiple aspects or dimensions: from knowledge about how the oceans work and our impact on them, to attitudes toward topics such as sustainable fisheries, and our behaviour as consumers, tourists, policy makers, fishermen, etc. The myriad ways in which individuals, society and the oceans interact result in complex dynamic systems, composed of multiple interlinked chains of cause and effect. To influence our understanding of these systems, and thereby increase our OL, means to increase our knowledge of our own and others’ place and role in the web of interactions. Systems Thinking has a potentially important role to play in helping us to understand, explain and manage problems in the human-ocean relationship. Leaders in the OL field have recommended taking a systems approach in order to deal with the complexity of the human-ocean relationship. They contend that the inclusion of modelling and simulation will improve the effectiveness of educational initiatives. In this paper we describe a pilot study centred on a browser-based Simulation-Based Learning Environment (SBLE) designed for a general audience that uses System Dynamics simulation to introduce and reinforce systems-based OL learning. It uses a storytelling approach, by explaining the dynamics of coastal tourism through a System Dynamics model revealed in stages, supported by fact panels, pictures, simulation-based tasks, causal loop diagrams and quiz questions. Participants in the pilot study were mainly postgraduate students. A facilitator was available to participants at all times, as needed. The model is based on a freely available normalised coastal tourism model by Hartmut Bossel, converted to XMILE format. Through the identification and use of systems archetypes and general systems features such as feedback loops, we also tested for the acquisition of transferable skills and the ability to identify, apply or create sustainable solutions. Levels of OL were measured before and after interaction with the tool using pre- and post-survey questionnaires and interviews. Results showed moderate to very large positive effects on all the OL dimensions, which are also shown to be associated with predictors of behaviour change. These results provide motivation for further research.},

	abstract = {Abstract It has traditionally been thought that midlatitude sea surface temperature (SST) variability is predominantly driven by variations in air–sea surface heat fluxes (SHFs) associated with synoptic weather variability. Here it is shown that in regions marked by the highest climatological SST gradients and SHF loss to the atmosphere, the variability in SST and SHF at monthly and longer time scales is driven by internal ocean processes, termed here “oceanic weather.” This is shown within the context of an energy balance model of coupled air–sea interaction that includes both stochastic forcing for the atmosphere and ocean. The functional form of the lagged correlation between SST and SHF allows us to discriminate between variability that is driven by atmospheric versus oceanic weather. Observations show that the lagged functional relationship of SST–SHF and SST tendency–SHF correlation is indicative of ocean-driven SST variability in the western boundary currents (WBCs) and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). By applying spatial and temporal smoothing, thereby dampening the signature SST anomalies generated by eddy stirring, it is shown that the oceanic influence on SST variability increases with time scale but decreases with increasing spatial scale. The scale at which SST variability in the WBCs and the ACC transitions from ocean to atmosphere driven occurs at scales less than 500 km. This transition scale highlights the need to resolve mesoscale eddies in coupled climate models to adequately simulate the variability of air–sea interaction. Away from strong SST fronts the lagged functional relationships are indicative of the traditional paradigm of atmospherically driven SST variability.},

	abstract = {In ocean wave modelling, accurately computing the evolution of the wind-wave spectrum depends on the source terms and the spectral bandwidth used. The wave dissipation rate source term which spectrally quantifies wave breaking and other dissipative processes remains poorly understood, including the spectral bandwidth needed to capture the essential model physics. The observational study of Sutherland and Melville (2015a) investigated the relative dissipation rate contributions of breaking waves, from large-scale whitecaps to microbreakers. They concluded that a large fraction of wave energy was dissipated by microbreakers. However, in strong contrast with their findings, our analysis of their data and other recent data sets shows that for young seas, microbreakers and small whitecaps contribute only a small fraction of the total breaking wave dissipation rate. For older seas, we find microbreakers and small whitecaps contribute a large fraction of the breaking wave dissipation rate, but this is only a small fraction of the total dissipation rate, which is now dominated by non-breaking contributions. Hence, for all the wave age conditions observed, microbreakers make an insignificant contribution to the total wave dissipation rate in the wave boundary layer. We tested the sensitivity of the results to the SM15a whitecap analysis methodology by transforming the SM15a breaking data using our breaking crest processing methodology. This resulted in the small-scale breaking waves making an even smaller contribution to the total wave dissipation rate, and so the result is independent of the breaker processing methodology. Comparison with other near-surface total TKE dissipation rate observations also support this conclusion. These contributions to the spectral dissipation rate in ocean wave models are small and need not be explicitly resolved.},

These arguments are strongly supported by flow visualization and pressure measurements carried out in a laboratory wind-wave flume. Furthermore, the pressure measurements show a greatly enhanced interfacial shear stress for a breaking wave compared with that over an unbroken wave of the same wavelength. The implications of these findings for wind-wave generation are discussed.},

	abstract = {When wind blows over the ocean, short wind-waves (of wavelength smaller than 10 m) are generated, rapidly reaching an equilibrium with the overlying turbulence (at heights lower than 10 m). Understanding this equilibrium is key to many applications since it determines (i) air–sea fluxes of heat, momentum and gas, essential for numerical models; (ii) energy loss from wind to waves, which regulates how swell is generated and how energy is transferred to the ocean mixed layer and; (iii) the ocean surface roughness, visible from remote sensing measurements. Here we review phenomenological models describing this equilibrium: these models couple a turbulence kinetic energy and wave action budget through several wave-growth processes, including airflow separation events induced by breaking waves. Even though the models aim at reproducing measurements of air–sea fluxes and wave growth, some of the observed variability is still unexplained. Hence, after reviewing several state-of-the-art phenomenological models, we discuss recent numerical experiments in order to provide hints about future improvements. We suggest three main directions, which should be addressed both through dedicated experiments and theory: (i) a better quantification of the variability wind-wave growth and of the role played by the modulation of short and breaking wind-waves by long wind-waves; (ii) an improved understanding of the imprint of wind-waves on turbulent coherent structures and; (iii) a quantification of the interscale interactions for a realistic wind-wave sea, where wind-and-wave coupling processes coexist at multiple time and space scales.},

This yields a coupling between long wind-waves and turbulence at heights of about 10 m. This new wind-and-waves coupling is thus not exclusively confined to the short wave range and heights below 5 m, where most of the momentum transfer to the waves is known to occur. The proposed framework clarifies the impact of wind-waves on Monin–Obukhov similarity theory, and the role of long wind-waves on the observed wind-wave variability of momentum fluxes. This work reveals which state variables related to the wind-wave coupling require more accurate measurements to further improve wind-over-waves models and parametrizations.},

Two such episodes in the summer of 2002 are examined (22–23 July and 11–14 August). In both cases, the pollutants that affected coastal New Hampshire and coastal southwest Maine were transported over coastal waters in stable layers at the surface. These layers were at least intermittently turbulent but retained their chemical constituents. The lack of deposition or deep vertical mixing on the overwater trajectories allowed pollutant concentrations to remain strong. The polluted plumes came directly from the Boston, Massachusetts, area. In the 22–23 July case, the trajectories were relatively straight and dominated by synoptic-scale effects, transporting pollution to the Maine coast. On 11–14 August, sea breezes brought polluted air from the coastal waters inland into New Hampshire.},

For a mixed sea with a multipeak spectrum, the peak component in the wind sea portion of the wave spectrum is not a good reference wavelength. A much better scaling wavelength is the weighted average of swell and wind sea following the consideration of equivalent momentum in the wave field. The resulting friction coefficient Cl/2 is referenced to the wind speed at one-half of the scaling wavelength Ul/2 instead of C10 referenced to the neutral wind speed at 10-m elevationU10. Although referencing the wind speed at a fixed elevation such asU10 is of practical necessity, Ul/2 is physically significant as the free-stream velocity in wave-modulated boundary layer flows. A simple procedure to apply the similarity relation of Cl/2 to obtain C10 is described.},

	abstract = {In a recent study, the dimensionless surface roughness spectrum has been empirically parameterized as a power-law function of the dimensionless wind speed expressed as the ratio of wind friction velocity and phase speed of the surface roughness wave component. The wave-number-dependent proportionality coefficient, A, and exponent, a, of the power-law function are derived from field measurements of the shortwave spectrum. To extend the roughness spectrum model beyond the wavenumber range of field data, analytical functions are formulated such that A and a approach their asymptotic limits: A0 and a0 toward the lowest wavenumber, and A‘ and a‘ toward the highest wavenumber. Of the four asymptotic values, A‘ is considered most questionable for the lack of reference information. When applied to the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) computation, the results are in good agreement (within about 2 dB) with field data or geophysical model functions (GMFs) for incidence angles between 208 and 408 but significant underestimation occurs for higher incidence angles. The comparison study of NRCS computation offers helpful guidelines for adjusting the asymptotic factors, especially the numerical value of A‘. Improved agreement between the computed NRCS (vertical polarization) using the new roughness spectrum with GMF is expanded to incidence angles between 208 and 608. The wind speed range of good agreement between calculation and GMF is below about 15 m s21 for Ku band and about 30 m s21 for C band.},

This problem is solved by combining different field data together. This gives a trend of decreasing zch with wave age, expressed as: zch = 1.89(cp/u∗)−1.59. Furthermore, it is shown that calculations of the wind friction velocities using the wave-spectra-dependent expression of Hansen and Larsen agrees quite well with measured values during RASEX.

The Wavelet Directional Method is used to track the varying energy density of the short waves with long-wave phase. Two sets of trials are run at six wind speeds for five different long waves for a total of 60 trials. The sensitivity of the mean short-wave energy density to wind speed, long-wave slope, and long-wave period is explored in terms of a balance between wind input and dissipation source terms in the evolution of a spectrum of water waves.

	abstract = {Ocean surface winds, currents, and waves play a crucial role in exchanges of momentum, energy, heat, freshwater, gases, and other tracers between the ocean, atmosphere, and ice. Despite surface waves being strongly coupled to the upper ocean circulation and the overlying atmosphere, efforts to improve ocean, atmospheric, and wave observations and models have evolved somewhat independently. From an observational point of view, community efforts to bridge this gap have led to proposals for satellite Doppler oceanography mission concepts, which could provide unprecedented measurements of absolute surface velocity and directional wave spectrum at global scales. This paper reviews the present state of observations of surface winds, currents, and waves, and it outlines observational gaps that limit our current understanding of coupled processes that happen at the air-sea-ice interface. A significant challenge for the coming decade of wind, current, and wave observations will come in combining and interpreting measurements from (a) wave-buoys and high-frequency radars in coastal regions, (b) surface drifters and wave-enabled drifters in the open-ocean, marginal ice zones, and wave-current interaction “hot-spots,” and (c) simultaneous measurements of absolute surface currents, ocean surface wind vector, and directional wave spectrum from Doppler satellite sensors.},

We have developed a physical model that takes into account, not only the Bragg mechanism, but also the non-Bragg scattering mechanism associated with wave breaking. A single model was built to explain on the same physical basis both the background behavior of the NRCS and the wave radar Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) at HH and VV polarization. The NRCS is assumed to be the sum of a Bragg part (two-scale model) and of a non-Bragg part. The description of the sea surface is based on the short wind wave spectrum (wavelength from few millimeters to few meters) developed by Kudryavtsev et al. [1999] and wave breaking statistics proposed by Phillips [1985]. We assume that non-Bragg scattering is supported by quasi-specular reflection from very rough wave breaking patterns and that the overall contribution is proportional to the white cap coverage of the surface. A comparison of the model NRCS with observations is presented. We show that neither pure Bragg nor composite Bragg model is able to reproduce observed feature of the sea surface NRCS in a wide range of radar frequencies, wind speeds, and incidence and azimuth angles. The introduction of the non-Bragg part in the model gives an improved agreement with observations. In Part 2, we extend the model to the wave radar MTF problem.},

However, these models are not able to correctly reproduce the NRCS in all configurations. In particular, even if they may provide consistent results for vertical transmit and receive (VV) polarization, they fail in horizontal transmit and receive (HH) polarization. In addition, there are still important discrepancies between model and observations of the radar modulation transfer function (MTF), which relates the modulations of the NRCS to the long waves. In this context, we have developed a physical model that takes into account not only the Bragg mechanism but also the non-Bragg scattering associated with radio wave scattering from breaking waves. The same model was built to explain both the background NRCS and its modulation by long surface wave (wave radar MTF problem). In part 1, the background NRCS model was presented and assessed through comparisons with observations. In this part 2, we extend the model to include a third underlying scale associated with longer waves (wavelength \&\#8764;10\&\#8211;300 m) to explain the modulation of the NRCS. Two contributions are distinguished in the model, corresponding to the so-called tilt and hydrodynamic MTF. Results are compared to observations (already published in the literature or derived from the FETCH experiment). As found, taking into account modulation of wave breaking (responsible for the non-Bragg mechanism) helps to bring the model predictions in closer agreement with observations. In particular, the large MTF amplitudes for HH polarization (much larger than for VV polarization) and MTF phases are better interpreted using the present model.},

Cyclonic (anticyclonic, respectively) eddies are associated with negative (positive) heat flux anomalies that tend to cool (warm) the marine atmospheric boundary layer. A composite analysis of the turbulent heat flux anomalies inside the eddies reveals a direct relationship between eddy amplitude and the intensity of such anomalies. In addition, these anomalies are stronger near the eddy center, decaying radially to reach minimum values outside the eddies.

A community survey of undergraduate professors was conducted along with subsequent interviews of community college professors to gather information on the practices and teaching needs of members of the oceanographic community. Our objective was to capture how undergraduate
professors are currently using oceanographic data in their teaching, to what degree they are using inquiry in their undergraduate teaching, and information on what effective practices exist for teaching with data. The majority of those surveyed (73\%) indicated that they have used data in their
teaching within the last year. Professors reported they found it useful to integrate data in their teaching to help students draw conclusions from evidence. Professors reported they are using online archived data, journal publications, and data that the professors had collected themselves.
The lowest percentage of professors indicated that they use online real-time data. Results indicate that professors were very likely to use a lecture (no inquiry) teaching strategy when using data in their classes. When asked where they could use the most help in improving their practice with
teaching with data, responses varied by career stage. There is a need for more exploration of effective practices for the integration of data into teaching and the need for data visualization tools that help undergraduate professors meet the demands of teaching 21st century science skills

Each exploration features an interactive data widget that allows students to explore a curated and canned dataset, but with enough interactivity to support their own process of inquiry. Additional content on each page includes background information and a number of orientation and interpretation questions, which ultimately guides students towards answering a higher-level research question. We have identified a 6-step process that has helped inform our development efforts, especially as we have integrated faculty instructors into the design process. The process includes a) identifying scientific concepts and skills, b) matching educational goals with available instrumentation or research results, c) finding available instrument data, d) cleaning up the dataset, e) building interactive visualizations, and f) adding context and educational surrounds.

	abstract = {Oceanographic measurements, though difficult and expensive, are essential for effective study, stewardship, preservation, and management of our oceanic and atmospheric systems. Ocean sciences have been driven by technologiesenabling new observations, discoveries, and modelling of diverse interdisciplinary phenomena. Despite rapid advances inocean sampling capabilities, the numbers of disciplinary variables that are necessary to solve oceanographic problems arelarge and increasing. In addition, the time and space scales of key processes span over ten orders of magnitude; presently, there remain major spectral gaps in our sampling. Thus, undersampling presents the main limitation to our understanding of global climate change; variability in fish biomass and regime shifts; and episodic and extreme events. Fortunately, recentadvances in ocean platforms and in situ autonomous sampling systems and satellite sensors are enabling unprecedented rates of data acquisition as well as the expansion of temporal and spatial coverage. Consequently, improved sampling strategies will lead to a reduction in ocean forecasting error for predictions of a multitude of atmospheric and oceanic processes. Nonetheless, major challenges remain to massively increase the variety and quantity of ocean measurements and to effectively coordinate, synthesize, and distribute oceanographic data sets. In particular, numbers of measurements are limited by the costs of instruments and their deployment as well as data processing and production of useful data products and visualizations. Looking forward, many novel and innovative technologies involving computing, nanotechnology, robotics, information and telemetry technologies, space sciences, and molecular biology are being developed at a fast pace for numerous applications (Kaku, 1997; Kurzweil, 1999). It is anticipated that several of these can and will be transitioned to the ocean sciences and will prove to be extremely beneficial for oceanographers in the next few decades. Already, autonomous, ‘robotic’ in situsampling, high spectral resolution optical and chemical instrumentation, multi-frequency acoustics, and biomolecular techniques are being utilized by a limited number of oceanographers. Also, increased temporal and spatial sampling capabilities for expanding numbers of interdisciplinary variables are being accelerated thanks to both new technologies and utilization of data assimilation models coupled with autonomous sampling platforms. Data networks coupled with internet connectivity are rapidly increasing access to and utilization of data sets. In this essay, we review recent technological progress for solving some key oceanographic problems and highlight some of the foreseeable challenges and opportunities of ocean science technologies and their applications.},

We characterize the vertical skin‐bulk temperature gradient induced by rain and find that it levels off at high rain rates, suggestive of a transition in skin‐layer physics that has been previously hypothesized in the literature. We also quantify the small bias that will be present in turbulent sensible heat fluxes parameterized from ocean temperature measurements made at typical “bulk” depths during a rain event. Finally, a wind threshold is observed above which the surface ocean remains well‐mixed during a rain event; however, the skin temperature is observed to decrease at all wind speeds in the presence of rain.},

Distinct Indigenous worldviews and complex knowledge systems have been passed on from generation to generation, evolving over time in a living process that continues to this day. Indigenous Peoples' knowledge systems hold methodologies and assessment processes that provide pathways for knowing and understanding the Arctic, which address all aspects of life, including the spiritual, cultural, and ecological, all in interlinked and supporting ways. For too long, Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and their knowledges have not been equitably included in many research activities. We argue for systematic change in how research-related activities are conducted in the Arctic. Bringing together multiple knowledge systems, specifically Indigenous Peoples' knowledge systems and science, can lead to more equitable, inclusive, and useful outcomes. The co-production of knowledge framework that we forward is designed to assist researchers, decision makers, and communities in moving toward those goals. Given increased interest in the Arctic by the research community, the complex, rapid, and ongoing change in Arctic systems, and amidst renewed and urgent calls for equity globally and across all spheres of life, adoption of a co-production of knowledge framework for the conduct of Arctic research is timely as well as a moral and intellectual imperative. Further, solutions to challenges facing the Arctic and global community are enhanced by the combined understanding of Indigenous Peoples' knowledges and science.},

	abstract = {Abstract The emerging picture of frontal scale air–sea interaction derived from high-resolution satellite observations of surface winds and sea surface temperature (SST) provides a unique opportunity to test the fidelity of high-resolution coupled climate simulations. Initial analysis of the output of a suite of Community Climate System Model (CCSM) experiments indicates that characteristics of frontal scale ocean–atmosphere interaction, such as the positive correlation between SST and surface wind stress, are realistically captured only when the ocean component is eddy resolving. The strength of the coupling between SST and surface stress is weaker than observed, however, as has been found previously for numerical weather prediction models and other coupled climate models. The results are similar when the atmospheric component model grid resolution is doubled from 0.5° to 0.25°, an indication that shortcomings in the representation of subgrid scale atmospheric planetary boundary layer processes, rather than resolved scale processes, are responsible for the weakness of the coupling. In the coupled model solutions the response to mesoscale SST features is strongest in the atmospheric boundary layer, but there is a deeper reaching response of the atmospheric circulation apparent in free tropospheric clouds. This simulated response is shown to be consistent with satellite estimates of the relationship between mesoscale SST and all-sky albedo.},

Over the past decade, ocean circulation models evolved through improved understanding, numerics, spatial discretization, grid configurations, parameterizations, data assimilation, environmental monitoring, and process-level observations and modeling. Important large scale applications over the last decade are simulations of the Southern Ocean, the Meridional Overturning Circulation and its variability, and regional sea level change. Submesoscale variability is now routinely resolved in process models and permitted in a few global models, and submesoscale effects are parameterized in most global models. The scales where nonhydrostatic effects become important are beginning to be resolved in regional and process models. Coupling to sea ice, ice shelves, and high-resolution atmospheric models has stimulated new ideas and driven improvements in numerics. Observations have provided insight into turbulence and mixing around the globe and its consequences are assessed through perturbed physics models. Relatedly, parameterizations of the mixing and overturning processes in boundary layers and the ocean interior have improved. New diagnostics being used for evaluating models alongside present and novel observations are briefly referenced. The overall goal is summarizing new developments in ocean modeling, including: how new and existing observations can be used, what modeling challenges remain, and how simulations can be used to support observations.},

The imposed SST heterogeneity is a single-sided warmor cold front with temperature jumps Δθ = (2, 21.5) K varying over a horizontal distance between [0.1, 26] km characteristic of an upper-ocean mesoscale or submesoscale regime. A Fourier-fringe technique is implemented in the LES to overcome the assumptions of horizontally homogeneous periodic flow. Grid meshes of 2.2 × 109 points with fine-resolution (horizontal, vertical) spacing (δx 5 δy, δz) 5 (4.4, 2) m are used. Geostrophic winds blowing across SST isotherms generate secondary circulations that vary with the sign of the front. Warm fronts feature overshoots in the temperature field, nonlinear temperature and momentum fluxes, a local maximum in the vertical velocity variance, and an extended spatial evolution of the boundary layer with increasing distance fromthe SST front. Cold fronts collapse the incoming turbulence but leave behind residualmotions above the boundary layer. In the case of awarm front, the internal boundary layer grows with downstream distance conveying the surface changes aloft and downwind. SST fronts modify entrainment fluxes and generate persistent horizontal advection at large distances from the front.},

In the present work, we use an ensemble of synthetic currents to force the wave model WAVEWATCHIII and assess the relative impact of current divergence and vorticity in modifying several properties of the waves, including direction, period, directional spreading, and significant wave height Hs. We find that the spatial variability of Hs is highly sensitive to the nature of the underlying current and that refraction is the main mechanism leading to gradients of Hs. The results obtained using synthetic currents were used to interpret the response of surface waves to realistic currents by running an additional set of simulations using the llc4320 MITgcm output in the California Current region. Our findings suggest that wave parameters could be used to detect and characterize strong gradients in the velocity field, which is particularly relevant for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite as well as several proposed satellite missions.},

Assuming that the statistical properties of the flow are stationary and homogeneous, we derive an expression for a diffusivity tensor of surface-wave action density. The small parameter in this expansion is the ratio of surface current speed to gravity wave group speed. For isotropic currents, the action diffusivity is expressed in terms of the kinetic energy spectrum of the flow. A Helmholtz decomposition of the sea-surface currents into solenoidal (vortical) and potential (divergent) components shows that, to leading order, the potential component of the surface velocity field has no effect on the diffusivity of wave action: only the vortical component of the sea-surface velocity results in diffusion of surface-wave action. We validate our analytic results for the action diffusivity by Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations through an ensemble of stochastic velocity fields.},

	abstract = {Currents effects on waves have led to many developments in numerical wave modeling over the past two decades, from numerical choices to parameterizations. The performance of numerical models in conditions with strong currents is reviewed here, and observed strong effects of opposed currents and modulations of wave heights by tidal currents in several typical situations are interpreted. For current variations on small scales, the rapid steepening of the waves enhances wave breaking. Using different parameterizations with a dissipation rate proportional to some measure of the wave steepness to the fourth power, the results are very different, none being fully satisfactory, which points to the need for more measurements and further refinements of parameterizations. For larger-scale current variations, the observed modifications of the sea state are mostly explained by refraction of waves over currents and relative wind effects, that is, the wind speed relevant for wave generation is the speed in the frame of reference moving with the near-surface current. It is shown that introducing currentsin wave models can reduce the errors on significant wave heights by more than 30\% in some macrotidal environments, such as the coast of Brittany, in France. This large impact of currents is not confinedto the locations where the currents are strongest, but also downwave from strong current gradients. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

Here we discuss the mass balance of landfast ice near Kotzebue (Qikiqtaġruk) during these two anomalously warm winters. We use in situ observations and a 1-D thermodynamic model to address three research questions developed in partnership with an Indigenous Advisory Council. In doing so, we improve our understanding of connections between landfast ice mass balance, marine mammals and subsistence hunting. Specifically, we show: (i) ice growth stopped unusually early due to strong vertical ocean heat flux, which also likely contributed to early start to bearded seal hunting; (ii) unusually thin ice contributed to widespread surface flooding. The associated snow ice formation partly offset the reduced ice growth, but the flooding likely had a negative impact on ringed seal habitat; (iii) sea ice near Kotzebue during the winters of 2017–18 and 2018–19 was likely the thinnest since at least 1945, driven by a combination of warm air temperatures and a persistent ocean heat flux.},

However, explicit impacts to harvesting of traditional resources for coastal Indigenous communities remain largely unquantified, particularly where the primary research questions are posed by the Indigenous community as a result of emerging approaches such as knowledge co-production. Here, we directly link reduced sea ice coverage to decreasing harvesting opportunities for ugruk (bearded seal, Erignathus barbatus) as a component of a partnership among a multidisciplinary team of scientists, Indigenous Elder Advisory Council, and sovereign Indigenous tribe in northwest Alaska, USA. We collaboratively established research questions, coordinated data collection, and interpreted results to understand the causes and consequences of changing ugruk harvests for the community of Qikiqtagruk • (Kotzebue). The duration of spring ugruk hunts by the Qikiqtagru • ŋmiut declined significantly during 2003–2019 due to a shift (∼3 weeks earlier) in the timing of regional sea ice breakup. Harvests now cease ∼26 d earlier than in the past decade. Using historical sea ice records, we further demonstrate that ice coverage in May now resembles conditions that were common in July during the mid-20th century. Overall, we show that climate change is constraining hunting opportunities for this traditional marine resource, although Qikiqtagru • ŋmiut hunters have so far been able to offset a shortened season with changes in effort. Notwithstanding recent hunting success in unprecedentedly sparse ice conditions, accessibility to traditional resources remains a prominent concern for many Arctic communities. Management and policy decisions related to Arctic marine mammal resources, such as ugruk, are therefore also interwoven with food security, well-being, and culture of Indigenous communities. Hence, research that originates with Indigenous sovereignty over the entire research process, such as demonstrated here, has the potential to also lead to more inclusive, sustainable, and equitable outcomes in the face of rapid and accelerating Arctic change.},

Kotzebue Sound, located in the southeastern corner of the Chukchi Sea, remained largely ice-free throughout the winter in a stark departure from both recorded history and Indigenous oral history. The only sea ice that persisted throughout the winter was landfast ice and most of this occupied a small corner of the Sound near the outflow of the Noatak and Kobuk Rivers. We present oceanographic and atmospheric time series from a heavily instrumented “ice-tethered observatory” located on this landfast ice above the river outflow channel. This observing station was deployed as part of the Ikaaġvik Sikukun (Iñupiaq for “Ice Bridges”) project, in which hypotheses and subsequent observational programs were co-produced in partnership with an Indigenous Elder Advisory Council in Kotzebue. The measurements allow us to quantify the heat budget of the ice above the outflow channel, and identify the ocean as the primary source of heat contributing to thinning of the ice, which began in early February and accelerated rapidly before the recovery of the station in April of 2019. In concert with the ice-tethered observations, we use 2 years of oceanographic measurements from the mouth of Kotzebue Sound to characterize the influence of river outflow on the heat budget of the landfast ice, revealing a seasonal pattern in which the rivers promote ice formation and growth in the fall/winter, but help to drive melting of the ice in spring and early summer.},

ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10. m to 60. m depending on the spectral band with a 290. km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {It has been recognized that modulated wave groups trigger wave breaking and generate energy dissipation events on the ocean surface. Quantitative examination of wave-breaking events and associated turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rates within a modulated wave group in the open ocean is not a trivial task. To address this challenging topic, a set of laboratory experiments was carried out in an outdoor facility, the Oil and Hazardous Material Simulated Environment Test Tank (203m long, 20m wide, 3.5m deep). TKE dissipation rates at multiple depths were estimated directly while moving the sensor platform at a speed of about 0.53ms -1 toward incoming wave groups generated by the wave maker. The largest TKE dissipation rates and significant whitecaps were found at or near the center of wave groups where steepening waves approached the geometric limit of waves. The TKE dissipation rate was O(10 -2 )Wkg -1 during wave breaking, which is two to three orders of magnitude larger than before and after wave breaking. The enhanced TKE dissipation rate was limited to a layer of half the wave height in depth. Observations indicate that the impact of wave breaking was not significant at depths deeper than one wave height from the surface. The TKE dissipation rate of breaking waves within wave groups can be parameterized by local wave phase speed with a proportionality breaking strength coefficient dependent on local steepness. The characterization of energy dissipation in wave groups from local wave properties will enable a better determination of near-surface TKE dissipation of breaking waves.},

	abstract = {Observations of microwave backscatter from shoaling and breaking surface waves acquired with a shore-based, coherent-on-receive X-band marine radar are presented. The radar was located at the dune cliff of a sandy beach with two breaker bars. Waves were approximately shore-normal (inclination \&lt; 10\&\#x00B0;) during the study period. Consistent with other studies, the backscatter intensity from breaking waves is significantly increased (\&\#x2248;10 dB compared to nonbreaking) with Doppler velocities close to the wave phase velocity in shallow water. The strong backscatter from active breakers can cause a significant amount of signal artifacts due to the leakage of pulse energy into adjacent range cells, in particular behind the breaking crests. In the near range, the backscatter from the undisturbed surface and such pulse smearing artifacts appear as distinct peaks inside the Doppler spectra. Thus, the velocity of both sources of scatterering can be retrieved using a dedicated peak separation algorithm. In the far range (r \&gt; 500 m), the artifacts dominate the Doppler signal behind breaking wave crests. Therefore, when investigating the spatio-temporal evolution of breaking wave-induced Doppler velocities with marine radar, the analysis should be restricted to the wave crests and the well-illuminated front faces of the waves. The evolution of Doppler spectra tracked along the crest of an exemplary individual breaking wave is extracted during the steepening, active- and post-breaking stage.},

	abstract = {Retrieving spectral wave parameters such as the peak wave direction and wave period from marine radar backscatter intensity is very well developed. However, the retrieval of significant wave height is difficult because the radar image spectrum (a backscatter intensity variance spectrum) has to be transferred to a wave spectrum (a surface elevation variance spectrum) using a modulation transfer function (MTF) which requires extensive calibration for each individual radar setup. In contrast to the backscatter intensity, the Doppler velocity measured by a coherent radar is induced by the radial velocity (or line-of-sight velocity) of the surface scattering and its periodic component is mainly the contribution of surface waves. Therefore, the variance of the Doppler velocity can be utilized to retrieve the significant wave height. Analyzing approximately 100 days of Doppler velocity measurements of a coherent-on-receive radar operating at X-band with vertical polarization in transmit and receive, a simple relation was derived and validated to retrieve significant wave heights. Comparison to wave measurements of a wave rider buoy as well as an acoustic wave and current profiler resulted in a root mean square error of 0.24ĝ€m with a bias of 0.08ĝ€m. Furthermore, the different sources of error are discussed and investigated.},

We present a novel wave-based UAS heading and position correction, improving the image rectification accuracy by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3.5 and the current measurements’ temporal repeatability by factors of 1.8–4.8. This validation study maps the currents at high spatiotemporal resolution (5 m and 4 s) across the {\textasciitilde}700-m-wide tidally dominated Bear Cut channel in Miami, Florida. The UAS currents are compared to flotsam tracks, obtained through automated UAS video object detection and tracking, drifter tracks, and acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements. The root-mean-square errors of the cross- and along-channel currents are better than 0.03 m s −1 for the flotsam comparison and better than 0.06 m s −1 for the drifter comparison; the latter revealed a 0.06 m s −1 along-wind bias due to wind- and wave-driven vertical current shear. UAS current mapping could be used to monitor river discharge, buoyant pollutants, or submesoscale fronts and eddies; the proposed wave-based heading and position correction enables its use in areas without ground control points.},

The main concept of the coherentization is based on the coherent on receive principle, where the coherence is achieved by measuring the phase of the transmitted pulse from a leak in the radar circulator, which then serves as a reference phase for the transmitted pulse. The Doppler shift frequency can be computed from two consecutive pulse-pairs in the time domain or from the first moment of the Doppler spectrum inferred by means of a short time Fast Fourier Transform. From the Doppler shift frequencies, radial speed maps of the backscatter of the ocean surface are retrieved.

	abstract = {The Arctic climate system includes numerous highly interactive small-scale physical processes in the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean. During and since the International Polar Year 2007-2009, significant advances have been made in understanding these processes. Here, these recent advances are reviewed, synthesized, and discussed. In atmospheric physics, the primary advances have been in cloud physics, radiative transfer, mesoscale cyclones, coastal, and fjordic processes as well as in boundary layer processes and surface fluxes. In sea ice and its snow cover, advances have been made in understanding of the surface albedo and its relationships with snow properties, the internal structure of sea ice, the heat and salt transfer in ice, the formation of superimposed ice and snow ice, and the small-scale dynamics of sea ice. For the ocean, significant advances have been related to exchange processes at the ice-ocean interface, diapycnal mixing, double-diffusive convection, tidal currents and diurnal resonance. Despite this recent progress, some of these small-scale physical processes are still not sufficiently understood: these include wave-turbulence interactions in the atmosphere and ocean, the exchange of heat and salt at the ice-ocean interface, and the mechanical weakening of sea ice. Many other processes are reasonably well understood as stand-alone processes but the challenge is to understand their interactions with and impacts and feedbacks on other processes. Uncertainty in the parameterization of small-scale processes continues to be among the greatest challenges facing climate modelling, particularly in high latitudes. Further improvements in parameterization require new year-round field campaigns on the Arctic sea ice, closely combined with satellite remote sensing studies and numerical model experiments.},

In this paper, results from a multi-scale remote-sensing program dedicated to the retrieval of level first-year sea ice (FYI) fp from dual co- and cross-polarisation C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscat-ter are detailed. Models which utilise the dominant effect of free-water melt ponds on the VV/HH (vertical transmit and vertical receive/horizontal transmit and horizontal receive) polarisation ratio at high incidence angles are tested for their ability to provide estimates of the subscale fp. Retrieved fp from noise-corrected Radarsat-2 quad-polarisation scenes are in good agreement with observations from coincident aerial survey data, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.05-0.07 obtained during intermediate and late stages of ponding. Weak model performance is attributed to the presence of wet snow and slush during initial ponding, and a synoptically driven freezing event causing ice lids to form on ponds. The HV/HH (horizontal transmit and vertical receive/horizontal transmit and horizontal receive) ratio explains a greater portion of variability in fp, compared to VV/HH, when ice lids are present. Generally low HV channel intensity suggests limited applications using dual cross-polarisation data, except with systems that have exceptionally low noise floors. Results demonstrate the overall potential of dual-polarisation SAR for standalone or complementary observations of fp for process-scale studies and improvements to model parameterisations.},

Cluster analysis on the videography data identified four distinct surface cover types during the summer melt season: snow, saturated snow, light-colored melt ponds, and dark-colored melt ponds. Melt pond coverage was found to be highly variable over our study area. We found that pond sizes tended to be twice as large in areas of high melt pond density compared to ponds in areas of low pond density owing to their interconnective nature. Video data also identified an elongated melt pond morphology pattern over the smoothest FYI within our study region. A derived estimate of the integrated shortwave albedo was strongly related to the fractional cover of snow on the surface (R2 = 0.86).

	abstract = {The evolution of landfast sea ice melt pond coverage, surface topography, and mass balance was studied in the Canadian Arctic during May-June 2011 and 2012, using a terrestrial laser scanner, snow and sea ice sampling, and surface meteorological characterization. Initial melt pond formation was not limited to low-lying areas, rather ponds formed at almost all premelt elevations. The subsequent evolution of melt pond coverage varied considerably between the 2 years owing to four principle, temporally variable factors. First, the range in premelt topographic relief was 0.5 m greater in 2011 (rougher surface) than in 2012 (smoother surface), such that a seasonal maximum pond coverage of 60\% and maximum hydraulic head of 204 mm were reached in 2011, versus 78\% and 138 mm in 2012. A change in the meltwater balance (production minus drainage) caused the ponds to spread or recede over an area that was almost 90\% larger in 2012 than in 2011. Second, modification of the premelt topography was observed during mid-June, due to preferential melting under certain drainage channels. Some of the lowest-lying premelt areas were subsequently elevated above these deepening channels and unexpectedly became drained later in the season. Third, ice interior temperatures remained 1-2°C colder later into June in 2012 than in 2011, even though the ice was 0.35 m thinner at melt onset, thereby delaying permeability increases in the ice that would allow vertical meltwater drainage to the ocean. Finally, surface melt was estimated to account for approximately 62\% of the net radiative flux to the sea ice cover during the melt season.

	abstract = {Abstract The Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment produced 18 000 h of turbulence data from the atmospheric surface layer over sea ice while the ice camp drifted for a year in the Beaufort Gyre. Multiple sites instrumented during SHEBA suggest only two aerodynamic seasons over sea ice. In ?winter? (October 1997 through 14 May 1998 and 15 September 1998 through the end of the SHEBA deployment in early October 1998), the ice was compact and snow covered, and the snow was dry enough to drift and blow. In ?summer? (15 May through 14 September 1998 in this dataset), the snow melted, and melt ponds and leads appeared and covered as much as 40\% of the surface with open water. This paper develops a bulk turbulent flux algorithm to explain the winter data. This algorithm predicts the surface fluxes of momentum, and sensible and latent heat from more readily measured or modeled quantities. A main result of the analysis is that the roughness length for wind speed z0 does not depend on the friction velocity u* in the drifting snow regime (u* ≥ 0.30 m s?1) but, rather, is constant in the SHEBA dataset at about 2.3 ? 10?4 m. Previous analyses that found z0 to increase with u* during drifting snow may have suffered from fictitious correlation because u* also appears in z0. The present analysis mitigates this fictitious correlation by plotting measured z0 against the corresponding u* computed from the bulk flux algorithm. Such plots, created with data from six different SHEBA sites, show z0 to be independent of the bulk u* for 0.15 {\textless} u* ≤ 0.65 m s?1. This study also evaluates the roughness lengths for temperature zT and humidity zQ, incorporates new profile stratification corrections for stable stratification, addresses the singularities that often occur in iterative flux algorithms in very light winds, and includes an extensive analysis of whether atmospheric stratification affects z0, zT, and zQ.},

	abstract = {Abstract The surface of the Arctic Ocean in summer is a mix of sea ice and water in both leads and melt ponds. Here we use data collected at multiple sites during the year-long experiment to study the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) to develop a bulk turbulent flux algorithm for predicting the surface fluxes of momentum and sensible and latent heat over the Arctic Ocean during summer from readily measured or modelled quantities. The distinctive aerodynamic feature of summer sea ice is that the leads and melt ponds create vertical ice faces that the wind can push against; momentum transfer to the surface is thus enhanced through form drag. In effect, summer sea ice behaves aerodynamically like the marginal ice zone, which is another surface that consists of sea ice and water. In our bulk flux algorithm, we therefore combine our SHEBA measurements of the neutral-stability drag coefficient at a reference height of 10 m, \${\textbackslash}hbox\{C\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm DN10\}\}\$, with similar measurements from marginal ice zones that have been reported in the literature to create a unified parametrization for \${\textbackslash}hbox\{C\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm DN10\}\}\$ for summer sea ice and for any marginal ice zone. This parametrization predicts \${\textbackslash}hbox\{C\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm DN10\}\}\$ from a second-order polynomial in ice concentration. Our bulk flux algorithm also includes expressions for the roughness lengths for temperature and humidity, introduces new profile stratification corrections for stable stratification, and effectively eliminates the singularities that often occur in iterative flux algorithms for very light winds. In summary, this new algorithm seems capable of estimating the friction velocity u* (a surrogate for the momentum flux) over summer sea ice with an absolute accuracy of 0.02?0.03 m s?1; the sensible heat flux, with an accuracy of about 6 W m?2; and the latent heat flux, with an accuracy of 3.5 W m?2.

	abstract = {Arctic sea ice is shifting from a year-round sea ice cover to a seasonal sea ice cover. This substantial transformation, via a reduction in Arctic sea ice extent and a thinning of its thickness, influences the amount of light entering the upper ocean. This in turn impacts under-ice algal growth and associated ecosystem dynamics. Field campaigns have provided valuable insights as to how snow and ice properties impact light penetration at fixed locations in the Arctic, but to understand the spatial variability in the underice light field there is a need to scale up to the pan-Arctic level. Combining information from satellites with state-of-the-art parameterizations is one means to achieve this. This study combines satellite and modelled data products to map under-ice light on a monthly time-scale from 2011 through 2018. Key limitations pertain to the availability of satellite-derived sea ice thickness, which for radar altimetry, is only available during the sea ice growth season. We clearly show that year-to-year variability in snow depth, along with the fraction of thin ice, plays a key role in how much light enters the Arctic Ocean. This is particularly significant in April which in some regions, coincides with the beginning of the under-ice algal bloom, whereas we find that ice thickness is the main driver of under-ice light availability at the end of the melt season in October. The extension to the melt season due to a warmer Arctic means that snow accumulation has reduced, which is leading to positive trends in light transmission through snow, which combined with a thinner ice cover, should lead to increased under-ice PAR also in the summer months.},

The bulk flux algorithm resulting from data collected over winter sea ice during SHEBA, the experiment to study the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean, failed, however, in its first trial to predict the turbulent momentum flux over sea ice in the Antarctic. This result suggests that the main parameter for predicting the momentum flux, the aerodynamics roughness length z0, does not respond just to the friction velocity, as in the SHEBA algorithm, but is closely related to the physical roughness of snow-covered sea ice and may need to be site-specific. I investigate this idea with simultaneous measurements of z0 and the physical roughness of the surface, ?, at Ice Station Weddell. The metric ? derives from surveys of surface elevation and is related to but always less than the standard deviation in surface elevation. On combining the z0?? pairs from Ice Station Weddell with similar data obtained over Arctic sea ice, I show that the Arctic and Antarctic z0?? data lie along a continuum such that measuring ? could provide a means for estimating a site-specific z0 for any global sea ice surface.

	abstract = {During spring and summer, the Arctic pack ice cover undergoes a dramatic change in surface conditions, evolving from a uniform, reflective surface to a heterogeneous mixture of bare ice, melt ponds, and leads. This transformation is accompanied by a significant decrease in areally averaged, integrated albedo. The key factors contributing to this reduction in albedo are the melting of the snow cover, the formation and growth of the melt ponds, and the increase in the open water fraction. To document these changes and enable quantification of the evolution of the ponds throughout the melt season, a program of aerial photography was carried out at the main site of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) program. A modified square pattern, 50 km on a side, surrounding the SHEBA site was flown at altitudes ranging from 1220 to 1830 m. Twelve of these aerial survey photography flights were completed between 20 May and 4 October 1998. The flights took place at approximately weekly intervals at the height of the melt season, with occasional gaps as long as 3 weeks during August and September due to persistent low clouds and fog. In addition, flights on 17 May and 25 July were flown in a closely spaced pattern designed to provide complete photo coverage of a 10-km square centered on the SHEBA main site. Images from all flights were scanned at high resolution and archived on CD-ROMs. Using personal computer image processing software, we have measured ice concentration, melt pond coverage, statistics on size and shape of melt ponds, lead fraction, and lead perimeter for the summer melt season. The ponds began forming in early June, and by the height of the melt season in early August the pond fraction exceeded 0.20. The temporal evolution of pond fraction displayed a rapid increase in mid-June, followed by a sharp decline 1 week later. After the decline, the pond fraction gradually increased until mid- August when the ponds began to freeze. By mid-September the surface of virtually all of the ponds had frozen. The open water fraction varied between 0.02 and 0.05 from May through the end of July. In early August the open water fraction jumped to 0.20 in just a few days owing to ice divergence. Melt ponds were ubiquitous during summer, with number densities increasing from 1000 to 5000 ponds per square kilometer between June and August.},

Satellite observations of ice concentration, onset dates of melt and freeze-up and ice age, are combined with ice thicknesses from the PIOMAS model and incident solar irradiance from reanalysis products to calculate the contributions of open ocean and ice to the solar heat input in the upper ocean. Of the total, 86\% of the area has positive trends for solar heat input to the ocean through leads due to decreases in ice concentration. Only 62\% of the area shows positive trends of solar heat input to the ocean explicitly through the ice. Positive trends are due to thinning ice, while negative trends occur in regions where the ice-free season has lengthened. The annual total solar heat input to the ocean exhibits positive trends in 82\% of the area. The spatial pattern of the cumulative annual total solar heat input is similar to the pattern of solar heat input directly to leads.},

Initially, this line was completely snow covered, but as the melt season progressed, it became a mixture of bare ice and melt ponds. Observed changes in albedo were a combination of a gradual evolution due to seasonal transitions and abrupt shifts resulting from synoptic weather events. There were five distinct phases in the evolution of albedo: dry snow, melting snow, pond formation, pond evolution, and fall freeze-up. In April the surface albedo was high (0.8-0.9) and spatially uniform. By the end of July the average albedo along the line was 0.4, and there was significant spatial variability, with values ranging from 0.1 for deep, dark ponds to 0.65 for bare, white ice. There was good agreement between surface-based albedos and measurements made from the University of Washington's Convair-580 research aircraft. A comparison between net solar irradiance computed using observed albedos and a simplified model of seasonal evolution shows good agreement as long as the timing of the transitions is accurately determined.},

This, together with acknowledged impacts on other components of the Earth system, has led to the term ?the new Arctic.? Global coupled climate models predict that ice loss will continue through the twenty-first century, with implications for governance, economics, security, and global weather. A wide range in model projections reflects the complex, highly coupled interactions between the polar atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere, including teleconnections to lower latitudes. This paper summarizes our present understanding of how heat reaches the ice base from the original sources?inflows of Atlantic and Pacific Water, river discharge, and summer sensible heat and shortwave radiative fluxes at the ocean/ice surface?and speculates on how such processes may change in the new Arctic. The complexity of the coupled Arctic system, and the logistic and technological challenges of working in the Arctic Ocean, require a coordinated interdisciplinary and international program that will not only improve understanding of this critical component of global climate but will also provide opportunities to develop human resources with the skills required to tackle related problems in complex climate systems. We propose a research strategy with components that include 1) improved mapping of the upper- and middepth Arctic Ocean, 2) enhanced quantification of important process, 3) expanded long-term monitoring at key heat-flux locations, and 4) development of numerical capabilities that focus on parameterization of heat-flux mechanisms and their interactions.},

	abstract = {The amount of ice growth and ablation are key measures of the thermodynamic state of the ice cover. While ice extent and even ice thickness can be determined using remote-sensing techniques, this is not the case for the mass balance. Mass-balance measurements require an ability to attribute the change, establishing whether a change in the thickness of the ice cover occurs at the top or bottom surface and whether it is a result of growth or ablation. We have developed and implemented a tool that can be used to measure thermodynamic changes in sea-ice mass balance at individual locations: the ice mass-balance buoy (IMB). The primary limitation of the IMB is that it provides a point measurement of the ice mass balance, defined by a particular combination of snow and ice conditions. Determining if, and how, such point measurements can be extrapolated is critical to understanding the large-scale mass balance of the sea-ice cover. We explore the potential for extrapolation using mass-balance observations from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) field experiment. During SHEBA, mass-balance measurements were made at over 100 sites covering a 100 km2 area. Results indicate that individual point measurements can provide reasonable estimates for undeformed and unponded multi-year ice, which represented more than two-thirds of the ice cover at SHEBA and is the dominant ice type in the perennial pack. A key is carefully selecting a representative location for the instrument package. The contribution of these point measurements can be amplified by integrating them with other tools designed to measure ice thickness and assimilating these combined data into sea-ice models.},

	abstract = {Climate change, amplified in the far north, has led to rapid sea ice decline in recent years. In the summer, melt ponds form on the surface of Arctic sea ice, significantly lowering the ice reflectivity (albedo) and thereby accelerating ice melt. Pond geometry controls the details of this crucial feedback; however, a reliable model of pond geometry does not currently exist. Here we show that a simple model of voids surrounding randomly sized and placed overlapping circles reproduces the essential features of pond patterns. The only two model parameters, characteristic circle radius and coverage fraction, are chosen by comparing, between the model and the aerial photographs of the ponds, two correlation functions which determine the typical pond size and their connectedness. Using these parameters, the void model robustly reproduces the ponds' area-perimeter and area-abundance relationships over more than 6 orders of magnitude. By analyzing the correlation functions of ponds on several dates, we also find that the pond scale and the connectedness are surprisingly constant across different years and ice types. Moreover, we find that ponds resemble percolation clusters near the percolation threshold. These results demonstrate that the geometry and abundance of Arctic melt ponds can be simply described, which can be exploited in future models of Arctic melt ponds that would improve predictions of the response of sea ice to Arctic warming.},

The comparison was performed by operating the two instruments on an oceanographic research platform during a crossing-sea condition. We analyzed the statistical properties of the wave field, and its directional and omni-directional energy distributions.

	abstract = {Melt ponds are key elements in the energy balance of Arctic sea ice. Observing their temporal evolution is crucial for understanding melt processes and predicting sea ice evolution. Remote sensing is the only technique that enables large-scale observations of Arctic sea ice. However, monitoring melt pond deepening in this way is challenging because most of the optical signal reflected by a pond is defined by the scattering characteristics of the underlying ice. Without knowing the influence of meltwater on the reflected signal, the water depth cannot be determined. To solve the problem, we simulated the way meltwater changes the reflected spectra of bare ice. We developed a model based on the slope of the log-scaled remote sensing reflectance at 710 nm as a function of depth that is widely independent from the bottom albedo and accounts for the influence of varying solar zenith angles. We validated the model using 49 in situ melt pond spectra and corresponding depths from shallow ponds on dark and bright ice. Retrieved pond depths are accurate (root mean square error, RMSE D 2:81 cm; nRMSE D 16 \%) and highly correlated with in situ measurements (r D 0:89; p D 4:341017). The model further explains a large portion of the variation in pond depth (R2 D 0:74). Our results indicate that our model enables the accurate retrieval of pond depth on Arctic sea ice from optical data under clear sky conditions without having to consider pond bottom albedo. This technique is potentially transferrable to hyperspectral remote sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles, aircraft and satellites.},

	abstract = {The partitioning of solar radiation in the Arctic sea ice during the melt season is investigated using a radiative transfer model containing three layers of melt pond, underlying sea ice, and ocean beneath ice. The wavelength distribution of the spectral solar irradiance clearly narrowed with increasing depth into ice, from 350–900 nm at the pond surface to 400–600 nm in the ocean beneath. In contrast, the net spectral irradiance is quite uniform. The absorbed solar energy is sensitive to both pond depth (Hp) and the underlying ice thickness (Hi). The solar energy absorbed by the melt pond (Ψp) is proportional only to Hp. However, the solar energy absorbed by the underlying ice (Ψi) is more complicated due to the counteracting effects arising from the pond and ice to the energy absorption. In September, Ψp decreased by 10\% from its August value, which is attributed to more components in the shortwave band ({\textless}530 nm) of the incident solar radiation in September relative to August. The absorption coefficient of the sea ice only enhances the absorbed energy in ice, while an increase in the ice scattering coefficient only enhances the absorbed energy in the melt pond, although the resulted changes in Ψp and Ψi are smaller than that in the albedo and transmittance. The energy absorption rate with depth depends strongly on the incident irradiance and ice scattering, but only weakly on pond depth. Our results are comparable to previous field measurements and numerical simulations. We conclude that the incident solar energy was largely absorbed by the melt pond rather than by the underlying sea ice.},

The SRB was deployed on drifting first-year sea ice near the North Pole in mid-April 2012, together with velocity and ice mass balance buoys. The buoys drifted southward and reached Fram Strait after approximately 7 months, covering a complete melt season. At the SRB site, snowmelt started on 10 June, and had completely disappeared by 14 July. Surface albedo was above 0.85 until snowmelt onset and decreased rapidly with the progression of snowmelt. Albedo was lowest on 14 July, when the observed surface was likely a mixture of bare ice and melt pond(s). The transmitted irradiance measured under the ice was largest in July, with a monthly average of 20 W m-2, compared to {\textless}0.3 W m-2 premelt. Under-ice irradiance peaked on 19-20 July, with a daily average around 35 W m -2. From mid-April to mid-September, the solar energy transmitted through the ice into the ocean contributed about two-thirds of the energy required for the observed bottom melt (0.49 m). The energy absorbed by the ice after snowmelt was enough to melt an additional 0.1 m of ice. Solar energy incident on open water and melt ponds provided significant additional heating, indicating solar heating could explain all of the observed bottom melt in this region in summer 2012. © 2014.

	abstract = {Over the past four decades, there has been a substantial thinning of the summer sea ice cover in the Beaufort Sea. Variations in sea ice mass balance reflect these changes and give insight to the environmental forcings which caused them. In this work, the time series results from eight Lagrangian mass balance sites that operated in the Beaufort Sea over the years 1997–2015 are analyzed. Direct measurements from the sites are combined with estimates of ice/ocean heat input to examine the roll of solar heating on ice loss, growth, and melt rates. Comparisons between ice and snow conditions and mass balance event timing, for example, surface and bottom melt onset, melt peak, and melt end, are also made. From the late 1990s to the present, a general increase in bottom melting and solar heat input to the upper ocean was observed. All sites showed a net loss of ice (ranging from 29 to 271 cm), and all but one site saw the majority of this loss from bottom melting. Bottom melt onset occurred within a relatively narrow 13-day window between 1 and 13 June at all sites. The amount of observed bottom melt was also related to the heat deposited in the ocean available for melting, underscoring the increasingly important role of ocean thermodynamics in determining sea ice mass balance.},

	abstract = {Warming in the Arctic has been much faster than the rest of the world in both observations and model simulations, a phenomenon known as the Arctic amplification (AA) whose cause is still under debate. By analyzing data and model simulations, here we show that large AA occurs only from October to April and only over areas with significant sea-ice loss. AA largely disappears when Arctic sea ice is fixed or melts away. Periods with larger AA are associated with larger sea-ice loss, and models with bigger sea-ice loss produce larger AA. Increased outgoing longwave radiation and heat fluxes from the newly opened waters cause AA, whereas all other processes can only indirectly contribute to AA by melting sea-ice. We conclude that sea-ice loss is necessary for the existence of large AA and that models need to simulate Arctic sea ice realistically in order to correctly simulate Arctic warming under increasing CO2. The cause of Arctic amplification is still heavily debated. Here the authors present climate change simulations to show that sea-ice loss is essential for the existence of Arctic amplification.},

Most work in this direction theorises co-production as an ‘iterative and interactive’ process between climate service providers and users, with success measured mainly in terms of the usefulness and usability of the information product for the user. But notwithstanding these first important steps, this perspective paper argues that the current study of climate service co-production is too narrowly framed, and fails to properly engage with the broad and rich literature that conceives of co-production processes in a diversity of ways. The authors suggest a fresh look on co-production as a process best examined simultaneously from several complimentary perspectives, with reference to recent work reconceptualising co-production as an eight-sided ‘prism’. Using an illustrative example of climate services developed to predict and visualise future flooding in the municipality of Voss, in Norway, the paper demonstrates how this prism concept of co-production can enable a more comprehensive view on co-production as a multi-faceted phenomenon, improve mutual understanding among actors and, ultimately, help design climate services that are better tailored for climate change responses in particular contexts.},

We develop indicators for assessing responsible community engagement in research practice and identify patterns in levels of Indigenous community engagement. We find that the vast majority of climate studies (87\%) practice an extractive model in which outside researchers use Indigenous knowledge systems with minimal participation or decision-making authority from communities who hold them. Few studies report on outputs that directly serve Indigenous communities, ethical guidelines for research practice, or providing Indigenous community access to findings. Further, studies initiated with (in mutual agreement between outside researchers and Indigenous communities) and by Indigenous community members report significantly more indicators for responsible community engagement when accessing Indigenous knowledges than studies initiated by outside researchers alone. This global assessment provides an evidence base to inform our understanding of broader social impacts related to research design and concludes with a series of guiding questions and methods to support responsible research practice with Indigenous and local communities.},

	abstract = {Drawing on examples mostly from Inupiaq and Yupik sea ice expertise in coastal Alaska, this contribution examines how local and indigenous knowledge (LIK) can inform and guide geophysical and biological sea ice research. Part of the relevance of LIK derives from its linkage to sea ice use and the services coastal communities derive from the ice cover. As a result, indigenous experts keep track of a broad range of sea ice variables at a particular location. These observations are embedded into a broader worldview that speaks to both long-term variability or change and the system of values associated with ice use. The contribution examines eight different contexts in which transmission of LIK is particularly relevant. These include the role of LIK in study site selection and assessment of a sampling campaign in the context of inter-annual variability, the identification of rare or inconspicuous phenomena or events, the contribution by indigenous experts to hazard assessment and emergency response, the record of past and present climate embedded in LIK, and the value of holistic sea ice knowledge in detecting subtle, intertwined patterns of environmental change. The relevance of local, indigenous sea ice expertise in helping advance adaptation and responses to climate change as well as its potential role in guiding research questions and hypotheses are also examined. The challenges that may have to be overcome in creating an interface for exchange between indigenous experts and sea ice researchers are considered. Promising approaches to overcome these challenges include cross-cultural, interdisciplinary education, and the fostering of Communities of Practice. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The Arctic spring phytoplankton bloom has been reported to commence under a melting sea ice cover as transmission of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400–700 nm) suddenly increases with the formation of surface melt ponds. Spatial variability in ice surface characteristics, i.e., snow thickness or melt pond distributions, and subsequent impact on transmitted PAR makes estimating light-limited primary production difficult during this time of year. Added to this difficulty is the interpretation of data from various sensor types, including hyperspectral, multispectral, and PAR-band irradiance sensors, with either cosine-corrected (planar) or spherical (scalar) sensor heads. To quantify the impact of the heterogeneous radiation field under sea ice, spectral irradiance profiles were collected beneath landfast sea ice during the Green Edge ice-camp campaigns in May–June 2015 and June–July 2016. Differences between PAR measurements are described using the downwelling average cosine, μd, a measure of the degree of anisotropy of the downwelling underwater radiation field which, in practice, can be used to convert between downwelling scalar, E0d, and planar, Ed, irradiance. A significantly smaller μd(PAR) was measured prior to snow melt compared to after (0.6 vs. 0.7) when melt ponds covered the ice surface. The impact of the average cosine on primary production estimates, shown in the calculation of depth-integrated daily production, was 16\% larger under light-limiting conditions when E0d was used instead of Ed. Under light-saturating conditions, daily production was only 3\% larger. Conversion of underwater irradiance data also plays a role in the ratio of total quanta to total energy (EQ/EW, found to be 4.25), which reflects the spectral shape of the under-ice light field. We use these observations to provide factors for converting irradiance measurements between irradiance detector types and units as a function of surface type and depth under sea ice, towards improving primary production estimates.},

In critically assessing the dominant trends we draw special attention to problems associated with the extraction of local knowledge without due consideration of how this process is embedded and inextricable from local contexts and sociotechnical orders. Drawing on theories of science and technology that examine the ontological politics of research practices, we propose a co-productive path forward for local knowledge mobilization to inform adaptation decision-making, which we argue facilitates the transformation of the institutional and governance arrangement of climate adaptation to provide greater flexibility and experimentalism in research and decision-making.

Heavier and more persistent sea ice provided a buffer against the influence of short-term climate fluctuations. Such recent increases in sea ice/atmospheric interactions lead to revisiting the concept of abrupt change. The Arctic climate is stabilized by a negative radiative feedback, as increased temperatures of the surface and atmospheric lose more long wave energy. However, through new shifts in albedo feedback, open ocean areas are absorbing more of the incoming solar heat. Recent multi-year environmental extremes, potential albedo instabilities, and increased sensitivity of sea ice to storms in marginal seas, are overcoming negative radiative feedback, which point to passing impending climatic and ecosystem thresholds. Unless CO2 emissions are reduced, further Arctic extremes are expected in the next decades with environmental and societal impacts spreading through the Arctic and beyond.},

A three-dimensional sea ice model with resolved melt ponds is used to diagnose pond onset date at a coastal site across years with observed surface fluxes but incomplete pond observations. Results show that the combined sensible and latent heat flux is the best predictor of pond formation date. This finding supports the hypothesis that synoptic weather events transporting warm, moist air into the Arctic are key to initiating pond formation, triggering albedo feedbacks, and, by extension, ice retreat. Changes in timing and frequency of spring warm air incursions may have significant implications on the ice cover and provide predictive power over seasonal ice retreat.},

	abstract = {Pond color, which creates the visual appearance of melt ponds on Arctic sea ice in summer, is quantitatively investigated using a two-stream radiative transfer model for ponded sea ice. The upwelling irradiance from the pond surface is determined and then its spectrum is transformed into RGB (red, green, blue) color space using a colorimetric method. The dependence of pond color on various factors such as water and ice properties and incident solar radiation is investigated. The results reveal that increasing underlying ice thickness Hi enhances both the green and blue intensities of pond color, whereas the red intensity is mostly sensitive to Hi for thin ice (Hi {\textless}1.5 m) and to pond depth Hp for thick ice (Hi {\textgreater}1.5 m), similar to the behavior of meltpond albedo. The distribution of the incident solar spectrum F0 with wavelength affects the pond color rather than its intensity. The pond color changes from dark blue to brighter blue with increasing scattering in ice, and the influence of absorption in ice on pond color is limited. The pond color reproduced by the model agrees with field observations for Arctic sea ice in summer, which supports the validity of this study. More importantly, the pond color has been confirmed to contain information about meltwater and underlying ice, and therefore it can be used as an index to retrieve Hi and Hp. Retrievals of Hi for thin ice (Hi {\textless}1 m) agree better with field measurements than retrievals for thick ice, but those of Hp are not good. The analysis of pond color is a new potential method to obtain thin ice thickness in summer, although more validation data and improvements to the radiative transfer model will be needed in future.},

	abstract = {The amount of solar radiation transmitted through Arctic sea ice is determined by the thickness and physical properties of snow and sea ice. Light transmittance is highly variable in space and time since thickness and physical properties of snow and sea ice are highly heterogeneous on variable time and length scales. We present field measurements of under-ice irradiance along transects under undeformed land-fast sea ice at Barrow, Alaska (March, May, and June 2010). The measurements were performed with a spectral radiometer mounted on a floating under-ice sled. The objective was to quantify the spatial variability of light transmittance through snow and sea ice, and to compare this variability along its seasonal evolution. Along with optical measurements, snow depth, sea ice thickness, and freeboard were recorded, and ice cores were analyzed for chlorophyll and particulate matter. Our results show that snow cover variability prior to onset of snow melt causes as much relative spatial variability of light transmittance as the contrast of ponded and white ice during summer. Both before and after melt onset, measured transmittances fell in a range from one third to three times the mean value. In addition, we found a twentyfold increase of light transmittance as a result of partial snowmelt, showing the seasonal evolution of transmittance through sea ice far exceeds the spatial variability. However, prior melt onset, light transmittance was time invariant and differences in under-ice irradiance were directly related to the spatial variability of the snow cover. © 2013 Author(s).},

We apply an existing, field data-based model to derive the depth of melt ponds, to airborne hyperspectral AisaEAGLE imagery and validate results with in situ measurements. ATCOR-4 results roughly match the shape of field spectra but overestimate reflectance resulting in high root-mean-square error (RMSE) (between 0.08 and 0.16). Noisy reflectance spectra may be attributed to the low flight altitude of 200 ft and Arctic atmospheric conditions. Empirical line calibration resulted in smooth, accurate spectra (RMSE {\textless} 0.05) that enabled the assessment of melt pond bathymetry. Measured and modeled pond bathymetry are highly correlated (r = 0.86) and accurate (RMSE = 4.04 cm), and the model explains a large portion of the variability (R2 = 0.74). We conclude that an accurate assessment of melt pond bathymetry using airborne hyperspectral data is possible subject to accurate atmospheric correction.

With complementary European ERA-Interim reanalysis, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate forecast system version 2 (CFSv2) analysis and satellite passive microwave data, we examine the evolution of atmospheric and surface melt conditions in the two differing melt seasons. Prevailing atmospheric conditions contributed to a longer and more continuous melt season in summer 2012 than in 2013, which was corroborated by in situ observations. ERA-Interim reanalysis data showed that longwave radiation likely played a key role in delaying the snowmelt onset in 2013. The earlier melt onset in 2012 reduced the albedo, providing a positive ice-albedo feedback at a time when solar insolation was high. Due to earlier melt onset and later freeze-up in 2012, more solar heat was deposited into the ice-ocean system than in 2013. Summer 2013 was characterized by later melt onset, intermittent freezing events and an earlier fall freeze-up, resulting in considerably fewer effective days of surface melt and a higher average albedo. Calculations for idealized seasonal albedo evolution show that moving the melt onset just 1 week earlier in mid-June increases the total absorbed solar radiation by nearly 14\% for the summer season. Therefore, the earlier melt onset may have been one of the most important factors driving the more dramatic melt season in 2012 than 2013, though atmospheric circulation patterns, e.g., cyclone in early August 2012, likely contributed as well.},

By partitioning the images into three distinct surface categories (sea ice/snow, water and melt ponds), the areal fraction of each category, ice concentration and the size and geometry of individual melt ponds, are determined with high-spatial resolution. The ice concentration and melt pond coverage have large spatial deviations between flights and even between images from the marginal ice zone to the pack ice zone in the central Arctic. Ice concentration and pond coverage over high Arctic (from 84°N to north) was {\textasciitilde}75\% and {\textasciitilde}6.8\%, respectively, providing ‘ground truth’ for the unusual transpolar reduction strip of ice indicated concurrently by AMSR-E data and for the regions (north of 88°N) where no passive microwave sensors can cover. Melt pond size and shape distributions are examined in terms of pond area (S), perimeter (P), mean caliper dimension (MCD) (L), roundness (R), convex degree (C), the ratio of P/S and fractal dimension (D). Power-law relationships are developed between pond size and number. Some general trends in geometric metrics are identified as a function of pond area including R, C, P/S and D. The scale separation of pond complexity is demonstrated by analyzing area-perimeter data.

Increased light transmission leads to increased deposition of solar energy in the upper ocean and thus plays a crucial role for amount and timing of sea-ice-melt and under-ice primary production. Recent developments in underwater technology provide new opportunities to study light transmission below the largely inaccessible underside of sea ice. We measured spectral under-ice radiance and irradiance using the new Nereid Under-Ice (NUI) underwater robotic vehicle, during a cruise of the R/V Polarstern to 83 N 6 W in the Arctic Ocean in July 2014. NUI is a next generation hybrid remotely operated vehicle (H-ROV) designed for both remotely piloted and autonomous surveys underneath land-fast and moving sea ice. Here we present results from one of the first comprehensive scientific dives of NUI employing its interdisciplinary sensor suite. We combine under-ice optical measurements with three dimensional under-ice topography (multibeam sonar) and aerial images of the surface conditions. We investigate the influence of spatially varying ice-thickness and surface properties on the spatial variability of light transmittance during summer. Our results show that surface properties such as melt ponds dominate the spatial distribution of the under-ice light field on small scales ({\textless}1000 m2), while sea ice-thickness is the most important predictor for light transmission on larger scales. In addition, we propose the use of an algorithm to obtain histograms of light transmission from distributions of sea ice thickness and surface albedo.},

	abstract = {The Arctic has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average since the late twentieth century, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA). Recently, there have been considerable advances in understanding the physical contributions to AA, and progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that link it to midlatitude weather variability. Observational studies overwhelmingly support that AA is contributing to winter continental cooling. Although some model experiments support the observational evidence, most modelling results show little connection between AA and severe midlatitude weather or suggest the export of excess heating from the Arctic to lower latitudes. Divergent conclusions between model and observational studies, and even intramodel studies, continue to obfuscate a clear understanding of how AA is influencing midlatitude weather. Amplified warming in the Arctic has been linked to weather variability in the midlatitudes. This Review considers the evidence from both observations and modelling studies on this link for increasing severe winter weather, including cold temperatures and heavy snowfalls.},

	abstract = {Under-ice irradiance measurements were done on ponded first-year pack ice along three transects during the ICE12 expedition north of Svalbard. Bulk transmittances (400-900 nm) were found to be on average 0.15-0.20 under bare ice, and 0.39-0.46 under ponded ice. Radiative transfer modelling was done with a plane-parallel model. While simulated transmittances deviate significantly from measured transmittances close to the edge of ponds, spatially averaged bulk transmittances agree well. That is, transect-average bulk transmittances, calculated using typical simulated transmittances for ponded and bare ice weighted by the fractional coverage of the two surface types, are in good agreement with the measured values. Radiative heating rates calculated from model output indicates that about 20\% of the incident solar energy is absorbed in bare ice, and 50\% in ponded ice (35\% in pond itself, 15\% in the underlying ice). This large difference is due to the highly scattering surface scattering layer (SSL) increasing the albedo of the bare ice.},

	abstract = {The growth of phytoplankton at high latitudes was generally thought to begin in open waters of the marginal ice zone once the highly reflective sea ice retreats in spring, solar elevation increases, and surface waters become stratified by the addition of sea-ice melt water. In fact, virtually all recent large-scale estimates of primary production in the Arctic Ocean (AO) assume that phytoplankton production in the water column under sea ice is negligible. However, over the past two decades, an emerging literature showing significant under-ice phytoplankton production on a pan-Arctic scale has challenged our paradigms of Arctic phytoplankton ecology and phenology. This evidence, which builds on previous, but scarce reports, requires the Arctic scientific community to change its perception of traditional Arctic phenology and urgently revise it. In particular, it is essential to better comprehend, on small and large scales, the changing and variable icescape, the under-ice light field and biogeochemical cycles during the transition from sea-ice covered to ice-free Arctic waters. Here, we provide a baseline of our current knowledge of under-ice blooms (UIBs), by defining their ecology and their environmental setting, but also their regional peculiarities (in terms of occurrence, magnitude and assemblages), which is shaped by a complex AO. To this end, a multidisciplinary approach, i.e. combining expeditions and modern autonomous technologies, satellite and modelling analyses have been used to provide an overview of this pan-Arctic phenological feature, which will become increasingly important in future marine Arctic biogeochemical cycles.},

In this paper, we examine the effects of a horizontally inhomogeneous sea ice layer on the light field in the water underneath. We implemented a three dimensional model, capable to simulate the light field underneath arbitrary surface geometries using ray optics. The results show clear effects of the measurement geometry on measured fluxes obtained with different sensor types, which need to be taken into account for the correct interpretation of the data. Radiance sensors are able to better sense the spatial variability of ice optical properties as compared to irradiance sensors. Furthermore we show that the determination of the light extinction coefficient of water from vertical profiles is complicated under a horizontally inhomogeneous ice cover. This uncertainty in optical properties of the water, as well as the measurement geometry also limits the possibility to correct light measurements taken at depth for the influence of water in between the sea ice and the sensor.},

These data, along with irradiance profiles taken within boreholes, laboratory measurements of the optical properties of core samples, ice physical property observations, and radiative transfer model simulations are employed to describe representative optical properties for melting first-year Arctic sea ice. Ponded ice was found to transmit roughly 4.4 times more total energy into the ocean, relative to nearby bare ice. The ubiquitous surface-scattering layer and drained layer present on bare, melting sea ice are responsible for its relatively high albedo and relatively low transmittance. Light transmittance through ponded ice depends on the physical thickness of the ice and the magnitude of the scattering coefficient in the ice interior. Bare ice reflects nearly three-quarters of the incident sunlight, enhancing its resiliency to absorption by solar insolation. In contrast, ponded ice absorbs or transmits to the ocean more than three-quarters of the incident sunlight. Characterization of the heat balance of a summertime ice cover is largely dictated by its pond coverage, and light transmittance through ponded ice shows strong contrast between first-year and multiyear Arctic ice covers.},

Here we use the Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble simulation to disentangle internally and externally forced winter Arctic sea ice variability, and to assess to what extent future winter sea ice variability and trends are driven by Atlantic heat transport. We find that OHT into the Barents Sea has been, and is at present, a major source of internal Arctic winter sea ice variability and predictability. In a warming world (RCP8.5), OHT remains a good predictor of winter sea ice variability, although the relation weakens as the sea ice retreats beyond the Barents Sea. Warm Atlantic water gradually spreads downstream from the Barents Sea and farther into the Arctic Ocean, leading to a reduced sea ice cover and substantial changes in sea ice thickness. The future long-term increase in Atlantic heat transport is carried by warmer water as the current itself is found to weaken. The externally forced weakening of the Atlantic inflow to the Barents Sea is in contrast to a strengthening of the Nordic Seas circulation, and is thus not directly related to a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The weakened Barents Sea inflow rather results from regional atmospheric circulation trends acting to change the relative strength of Atlantic water pathways into the Arctic. Internal OHT variability is associated with both upstream ocean circulation changes, including AMOC, and large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies reminiscent of the Arctic Oscillation.},

	abstract = {Arctic sea ice has not only decreased in volume during the last decades, but has also changed in its physical properties towards a thinner and more seasonal ice cover. These changes strongly impact the energy budget, and might affect the ice-associated ecosystems. In this study, we quantify solar shortwave fluxes through sea ice for the entire Arctic during all seasons. To focus on sea-ice-related processes, we exclude fluxes through open water, scaling linearly with sea ice concentration. We present a new parameterization of light transmittance through sea ice for all seasons as a function of variable sea ice properties. The maximum monthly mean solar heat flux under the ice of 30 × 105 Jm-2 occurs in June, enough heat to melt 0.3 m of sea ice. Furthermore, our results suggest that 96\% of the annual solar heat input through sea ice occurs during only a 4-month period from May to August. Applying the new parameterization to remote sensing and reanalysis data from 1979 to 2011, we find an increase in transmitted light of 1.5\% yr-1 for all regions. This corresponds to an increase in potential sea ice bottom melt of 63\% over the 33-year study period. Sensitivity studies reveal that the results depend strongly on the timing of melt onset and the correct classification of ice types. Assuming 2 weeks earlier melt onset, the annual transmitted solar radiation to the upper ocean increases by 20\%. Continuing the observed transition from a mixed multi-year/first-year sea ice cover to a seasonal ice cover results in an increase in light transmittance by an additional 18\%.},

However, it remains unclear whether these observed links are causal, and model experiments suggest that they might not be. Here we apply two independent approaches to infer causality from observations and climate models and to reconcile these sources of data. Models capture the observed correlations between reduced sea ice and cold mid-latitude winters, but only when reduced sea ice coincides with anomalous heat transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, implying that the atmosphere is driving the loss. Causal inference from the physics-based approach is corroborated by a lead–lag analysis, showing that circulation-driven temperature anomalies precede, but do not follow, reduced sea ice. Furthermore, no mid-latitude cooling is found in modelling experiments with imposed future sea-ice loss. Our results show robust support for anomalous atmospheric circulation simultaneously driving cold mid-latitude winters and mild Arctic conditions, and reduced sea ice having a minimal influence on severe mid-latitude winters. Two independent methods, applied to observations and climate models, suggest that changes in atmospheric circulation drive cold winters in mid-latitudes and coincident mild Arctic winters. Reduced Arctic sea ice causes Arctic warming but has minimal influence on the severity of mid-latitude winters.},

The long-term trends and seasonal evolutions of ice concentration, composite albedo, and ice albedo were then obtained. In July–August 1982–2009, the linear trend of the composite albedo and the ice albedo was −0.069 and −0.046 units per decade, respectively. During 1 June to 19 August, melting of sea ice resulted in an increase of solar heat input to the ice-ocean system by 282 MJ·m−2 from 1982 to 2009. However, because of the counter-balancing effects of the loss of sea ice area and the enhanced ice surface melting, the trend of solar heat input to the ice was insignificant. The summer evolution of ice albedo matched the ice surface melting and ponding well at basin scale. The ice albedo showed a large difference between the multiyear and first-year ice because the latter melted completely by the end of a melt season. At the SHEBA geolocations, a distinct change in the ice albedo has occurred since 2007, because most of the multiyear ice has been replaced by first-year ice. A positive polarity in the Arctic Dipole Anomaly could be partly responsible for the rapid loss of summer ice within the study region in the recent years by bringing warmer air masses from the south and advecting more ice toward the north. Both these effects would enhance ice-albedo feedback.},

Field results show that phytoplankton effectively acclimated to reduced irradiance beneath the sea ice by maximizing light absorption and photosynthetic capacity. In fact, exceptionally high maximum photosynthetic rates and efficiency observed during the spring demonstrate that abundant nutrients enable prebloom phytoplankton to become “primed” for increases in irradiance. This ability to quickly exploit increasing irradiance can help explain the ability of phytoplankton to generate massive blooms beneath sea ice. In comparison, phytoplankton growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced postbloom due to severe nutrient limitation. These results advance our knowledge of photoacclimation by polar phytoplankton in extreme environmental conditions and indicate how phytoplankton may acclimate to future changes in light and nutrient resources under continued climate change.},

	abstract = {We examine the flows induced by horizontally modulated, vertically confined (or guided), internal wavepackets in a stratified, Boussinesq fluid. The wavepacket induces both an Eulerian flow and a Stokes drift, which together determine the Lagrangian transport of passive tracers. We derive equations describing the wave-induced flows in arbitrary stable stratification and consider four special cases: a two-layer fluid, symmetric and asymmetric piecewise constant ('top-hat') stratification and, more representative of the ocean, exponential stratification. In a two-layer fluid, the Stokes drift is positive everywhere with the peak value at the interface, whereas the Eulerian flow is negative and uniform with depth for long groups. Combined, the net depth-integrated Lagrangian transport is zero. If one layer is shallower than the other, the wave-averaged interface displaces into that layer making the Eulerian flow in that layer more negative and the Eulerian flow in the opposite layer more positive so that the depth-integrated Eulerian transports are offset by the same amount in each layer. By contrast, in continuous stratification the depth-integrated transport due to the Stokes drift and Eulerian flow are each zero, but the Eulerian flow is singular if the horizontal phase speed of the induced flow equals the group velocity of the wavepacket, giving rise to a single resonance in uniform stratification (McIntyre, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 60, 1973, pp. 801-811). In top-hat stratification, this single resonance disappears, being replaced by multiple resonances occurring when the horizontal group velocity of the wavepacket matches the horizontal phase speed of higher-order modes. Furthermore, if the stratification is not vertically symmetric, then the Eulerian induced flow varies as the inverse squared horizontal wavenumber for shallow waves, the same as for the asymmetric two-layer case. This 'infrared catastrophe' also occurs in the case of exponential stratification suggesting significant backward near-surface transport by the Eulerian induced flow for modulated oceanic internal modes. Numerical simulations are performed confirming these theoretical predictions.},

Even considering state-of-the-art methods, with typical image resolutions, it's unlikely to perform the first step in less than dozens of seconds (without paralellization), that can easily doubled if we include the subsequent interpolation step. This will limit the applicability of stereo based wave analysis for all the approaches (like monitoring or data assimilation) in which the time between the raw acquisition and the output of processed data is critical. In this paper, we propose a new method to directly estimate the sea surface spectrum over time from a sequence of stereo frames. We exploit the frequency dispersion relation of gravity waves and the (Non-uniform) Fast Fourier Transform to continuously update the 3D surface and 2D wavenumber spectrum estimations given a sparse set of matching features between the two frames. This effectively combines the two aforementioned steps with a performance gain of more than an order of magnitude while keeping a reconstruction accuracy that is extremely close to the current state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper we consider an ocean setting with inertial particles elastically connected forming a network that floats at the interface with the atmosphere. The network evolves according to a recently derived and validated Maxey-Riley equation for inertial particle motion in the ocean. We rigorously show that, under sufficiently calm wind conditions, rotationally coherent quasigeostrophic vortices (which have material boundaries that resist outward filamentation) always possess finite-time attractors for elastic networks if they are anticyclonic, while if they are cyclonic provided that the networks are sufficiently stiff. This result is supported numerically under more general wind conditions and, most importantly, is consistent with observations of rafts of pelagic Sargassum, for which the elastic inertial networks represent a minimal model. Furthermore, our finding provides an effective mechanism for the long range transport of Sargassum, and thus for its connectivity between accumulation regions and remote sources.},

	abstract = {Wave shape (i.e. skewness or asymmetry) plays an important role in beach morphology evolution, remote sensing and ship safety. The wind's influence on ocean waves has been extensively studied theoretically in the context of growth, but most theories are phase averaged and cannot predict wave shape. Most laboratory and numerical studies similarly focus on wave growth. A few laboratory experiments have demonstrated that wind can change wave shape, and two-phase numerical simulations have also noted wind-induced wave-shape changes. However, the wind's effect on wave shape is poorly understood, and no theory for it exists. For weakly nonlinear waves, wave-shape parameters are the phase of the first harmonic relative to the primary frequency (or harmonic phase HP, zero for a Stokes wave) and relative amplitude of the first harmonic to the primary wave. Here, surface pressure profiles (denoted Jeffreys, Miles and generalized Miles) are prescribed based on wind-wave generation theories. Theoretical solutions are derived for quasi-periodic progressive waves and the wind-induced changes to the HP, relative harmonic amplitude, as well as the already known phase speed changes and growth rates. The wave-shape parameters depend upon the chosen surface pressure profile, pressure magnitude and phase relative to the wave profile and non-dimensional depth. Wave asymmetry is linked to the non-dimensional growth rate. Atmospheric large eddy simulations constrain pressure profile parameters. The HP predictions are qualitatively consistent with laboratory observations. This theory, together with the HP and relative harmonic amplitude observables, can provide insight into the actual wave surface pressure profile.},

	abstract = {During its periodic motion, a particle floating at the free surface of a water wave experiences a net drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation, known as the Stokes drift (Stokes 1847 Trans. Camb. Philos. Soc. 8, 441–455). More generally, the Stokes drift velocity is the difference between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a fluid parcel and the average Eulerian flow velocity of the fluid. This paper reviews progress in fundamental and applied research on the induced mean flow associated with surface gravity waves since the first description of the Stokes drift, now 170 years ago. After briefly reviewing the fundamental physical processes, most of which have been established for decades, the review addresses progress in laboratory and field observations of the Stokes drift. Despite more than a century of experimental studies, laboratory studies of the mean circulation set up by waves in a laboratory flume remain somewhat contentious. In the field, rapid advances are expected due to increasingly small and cheap sensors and transmitters, making widespread use of small surface-following drifters possible. We also discuss remote sensing of the Stokes drift from high-frequency radar. Finally, the paper discusses the three main areas of application of the Stokes drift: in the coastal zone, in Eulerian models of the upper ocean layer and in the modelling of tracer transport, such as oil and plastic pollution. Future climate models will probably involve full coupling of ocean and atmosphere systems, in which the wave model provides consistent forcing on the ocean surface boundary layer. Together with the advent of new space-borne instruments that can measure surface Stokes drift, such models hold the promise of quantifying the impact of wave effects on the global atmosphere–ocean system and hopefully contribute to improved climate projections.

UAVs, like satellites and aircraft can provide a synoptic view of a relatively large area. However, the coarse resolution provided by satellites and the operational limitations of manned aircraft has motivated the development of unmanned systems. UAVs offer unparalleled flexibility of tasking; for example, low altitude flight and slow airspeed allow for the characterization of a wide variety of geophysical phenomena at the ocean surface and in the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Here, we present the development of cutting-edge payload instrumentation for UAVs that provides a new capability for ship-deployed operations to capture a unique, high resolution spatial and temporal variability of the changing air-sea interaction processes than was previously possible. The modular design of the base payload means that new instruments can be incorporated into new research proposals that may include new instruments for expanded use of the payloads as a long-term research facility. Additionally, we implement a novel capability for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) from research vessels. This VTOL capability is safer and requires less logistical support than previous ship-deployed systems. The payloads developed include thermal infrared, visible broadband and hyperspectral, and near-infrared hyperspectral high-resolution imaging. Additional capabilities include quantification of the longwave and shortwave hemispheric radiation budget (up- and down-welling) as well as direct air-sea turbulent fluxes. Finally, a UAV-deployed dropsonde-microbuoy was developed in order to profile the temperature, pressure and humidity of the atmosphere and the temperature and salinity of the near-surface ocean. These technological advancements provide the next generation of instrumentation capability for UAVs. When deployed from research vessels, UAVs will provide a transformational science prism unequaled using 1-D data snapshots from ships or moorings alone.},

Previous work showed that wind affects wave shape in intermediate and deep water. Here, we investigate the effect of wind on wave shape in shallow water through a wind-induced surface pressure for different wind speeds and directions. A multiple-scale analysis of long waves propagating over a shallow, flat bottom and forced by a Jeffreys-type surface pressure produces a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)-Burgers equation for the wave profile. The evolution of a symmetric, solitary wave initial condition is calculated numerically. The resulting wave grows (decays) for onshore (offshore) wind and becomes asymmetric, with the rear face showing the largest shape changes. The wave profile’s deviation from a reference solitary wave shows a bound, dispersive, decaying tail. The onshore wind increases the wave’s energy and skewness with time while decreasing the wave’s asymmetry, with the opposite holding for offshore wind. The corresponding wind speeds are shown to be physically realistic, and the shape changes are explained as slow growth followed by rapid evolution according to the unforced KdV equation.},

The motion of particles near the free surface is dominated by the waves and their Stokes drift, whereas particles at large depths follow horseshoe-shaped trajectories dominated by the Eulerian return flow. For unidirectional wave groups, a small net displacement in the direction of travel of the group results near the surface, and is accompanied by a net particle displacement in the opposite direction at depth. For deep-water waves, we study these trajectories experimentally by means of particle tracking velocimetry in a two-dimensional flume. In doing so, we provide visual illustration of Lagrangian trajectories under groups, including the contributions of both the Stokes drift and the Eulerian return flow to both the horizontal and the vertical Lagrangian displacements. We compare our experimental results to leading-order solutions of the irrotational water wave equations, finding good agreement.},

An important physical process affecting surface particles but missing in such analyses is wave-induced Stokes drift.

The convergence region moves from the east to the west of the basin, so particles leak to the South Atlantic rather than the South Pacific.

Using this method we analyze trends in melt onset and freezeup for 10 different Arctic regions. In all regions except for the Sea of Okhotsk, which shows a very slight and statistically insignificant positive trend (0.4 d decade-1), trends in melt onset are negative, i.e., toward earlier melt. The trends range from - 1.0 d decade-1 for the Bering Sea to -7.3 d decade-1 for the East Greenland Sea. Except for the Sea of Okhotsk all areas also show a trend toward later autumn freeze onset. The Chukchi/Beaufort seas and Laptev/East Siberian seas observe the strongest trends with 7 d decade-1.

During late spring and summer, the ponds determine sea ice albedo and how much solar radiation is transmitted into the upper ocean through the sea ice. The initial formation of ponds requires that melt water be retained above sea level on the ice surface. Both theory and observations, however, show that first year sea ice is so highly porous prior to the formation of melt ponds that multiday retention of water above hydraulic equilibrium should not be possible. Here we present results of percolation experiments that identify and directly demonstrate a mechanism allowing melt pond formation. The infiltration of fresh water into the pore structure of sea ice is responsible for blocking percolation pathways with ice, sealing the ice against water percolation, and allowing water to pool above sea level. We demonstrate that this mechanism is dependent on fresh water availability, known to be predominantly from snowmelt, and ice temperature at melt onset. We argue that the blockage process has the potential to exert significant control over interannual variability in ice albedo. Finally, we suggest that incorporating the mechanism into models would enhance their physical realism. Full treatment would be complex. We provide a simple temperature threshold-based scheme that may be used to incorporate percolation blockage behavior into existing model frameworks.},

Once surface ice melt begins, seasonal ice albedos are consistently less than albedos for multiyear ice resulting in more solar heat absorbed in the ice and transmitted to the ocean. The shift from a multiyear to seasonal ice cover has significant implications for the heat and mass budget of the ice and for primary productivity in the upper ocean.

The additional heat stored in the upper ocean of approximately 752 MJ m-2 during the last decade increases sea surface temperatures by 0.5 to 1.5 °C and largely explains the observed delays in autumn freezeup within the Arctic Ocean's adjacent seas. Cumulative anomalies in total absorbed solar radiation from May through September for the most recent pentad locally exceed 300-400 MJ m-2 in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and East Siberian seas. This extra solar energy is equivalent to melting 0.97 to 1.3 m of ice during the summer.

	abstract = {The partitioning of incident solar radiation between sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere strongly affects the Arctic energy balance during summer. In addition to spectral albedo of the ice surface, transmission of solar radiation through the ice is critical for assessing heat and mass balances of sea ice. Observations of spectral irradiance profiles within and transmittance through ice in the Beaufort Sea during the summer of 1998 during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) are presented. Sites representative of melting multiyear and first-year ice, along with ponded ice were measured. Observed spectral irradiance extinction coefficients (Kλ) show broad minima near 500 nm and strong increases at near-infrared wavelengths. The median Kλ at 600 nm for the bare ice cases is close to 0.8 m -1 and about 0.6 m-1 for ponded ice. Values are considerably smaller than the previously accepted value of 1.5 m-1. Radiative transfer models were used to analyze the observations and obtain inherent optical properties of the ice. Derived scattering coefficients range from 500 m-1 to 1100 m-1 in the surface layer and 8 to 30 m-1 in the ice interior. While ponded ice is known to transmit a significant amount of shortwave radiation to the ocean, the irradiance transmitted through bare, melting ice is also shown to be significant. The findings of this study predict 3-10 times more solar radiation penetrating the ice cover than predicted by a current GCM (CCSM3) parameterization, depending on ice thickness, pond coverage, stage of the melt season, and specific vertical scattering coefficient profile.

Although melt ponds evolve in stages, sea ice with smoother surface topography typically allows the pond water to spread over a wider area, reducing the ice-albedo and accelerating further melt. Here we develop this theory into a quantitative relationship between premelt sea ice surface roughness and summer melt pond coverage. Our method, applied to ICESat observations of the end-of-winter sea ice roughness, can account for 85\% of the variance in advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations of the summer ice-albedo. An Arctic-wide reduction in sea ice roughness from 2003 to 2008 explains a drop in ice-albedo that resulted in a 16\% increase in solar heat input to the sea ice cover, which represents ten times the heat input contributed by earlier melt onset timing over the same period.},

	abstract = {In the course of a program studying Arctic coastal processes we have investigated the albedos for the range of surfaces in the region and their response to seasonal changes in a land-ice-ocean regime near Barrow, Alaska. From April through June in the years 2000, 2001, and 2002, spectral and wavelength-integrated albedos were measured along 200-m survey lines. These lines were installed at four sites and included sea ice, lagoon ice, fresh ice, and tundra. Initially, all sites were completely snow-covered, and the albedo was high (0.8-0.85) and spatially uniform. The concentration of absorptive contaminants in the snow was enough to produce a slight reduction below the pure snow values. As the melt season progressed, albedos decreased at all sites. The decrease was greatest and most rapid at the tundra site, where the albedo dropped from 0.8 to 0.15 in only 2 weeks. The spectral signature also changed as the wavelength of maximum albedo at the tundra site shifted from 500 nm for snow to 1100 nm for vegetation. As the snow cover melted, there was rapid and extensive ponding, resulting in a decrease of the spatially averaged, wavelength-integrated albedo from 0.6 to 0.2 in only 5 days. Extensive pond drainage and below-freezing temperatures caused the albedo to rebound briefly to 0.55 before resuming a steady decrease. Comparison of these results with data collected in the central Arctic show that albedos of fast ice in the coastal regime evolve significantly faster than pack ice albedos. Interannual seasonal variations showed additional melting phases that might be expected during protracted warming. The albedo evolution in the coastal lagoon was different each of the 3 years because of variations in sediment loading of the ice during freeze-up and in the melt/freeze pattern the following spring. The record early melt in May 2002 followed by a pronounced freezing event 2 weeks later produced a distinct melt regime that gave rise to reduced melt pond coverage and higher albedo. Such events provide insight into processes associated with the melt ponds that will be important for modeling sea ice in a warming climate. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract = {The sea ice cover of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas is currently undergoing a fundamental shift from multiyear ice to first-year ice. Field observations of sea ice physical and optical properties were collected in this region during June-July 2010, revealing unexpectedly complex spatial distributions of solar radiation under the melt-season ice cover. Based on our optical measurements of first-year ice, we found the under-ice light field in the upper ocean to be spatially heterogeneous and dependent on wavelength, ice thickness, and the areal and geometric distribution of melt ponded and bare ice surfaces. Much of the observed complexity in radiation fields arose because the transmission of light through ponded ice was generally an order of magnitude greater than through bare, unponded ice. Furthermore, while many sites exhibited a consistent, exponential decay in light transmission through both ponded and bare ice surfaces, light transmission under bare ice was also observed to increase with depth (reaching maximum values ∼5-10 m below the bottom of the ice). A simple geometric model shows these transmission peaks are a result of scattering in the ice and the interspersion of bare and ponded sea ice surfaces. These new observations of complex radiation fields beneath melt-season first-year sea ice have significant implications for biological production, biogeochemical processes, and the heat balance of sea ice and under-ice ocean waters and should be carefully considered when modeling these sea ice-related phenomena.

	abstract = {Clouds significantly influence the Arctic surface energy budget and a realistic representation of this impact is a key for proper simulation of the present-day and future climate. Considerable across-model spread in cloud variables remains in the fifth phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ensemble and partly explains the substantial across-model spread in the surface radiative effect of the clouds. In summer, the extensive model differences in sea-ice albedo, which sets the potential of the cloud-albedo effect, are strongly positively correlated to their cloud radiative effect. This indicates that the model's sea-ice albedo not only determines the amount, but also the sign of its cloud radiative effect. The analysis further suggests that the present-day annual amplitude of sea-ice cover depends inversely on the model's sea-ice albedo. Given the present-day across-model spread in sea-ice albedo and coverage, a transition to a summer ice-free Arctic ocean translates to a model-span of increased surface shortwave absorption of about 75 W m -2.

The all-wave albedos vary from 0.07 for open water to 0.87 for thick snow-covered ice under cloud.

The ASPeCt dataset contains routine hourly visual observations of sea ice from research and supply ships of several nations using a standard protocol, Ten thousand of these observations, separated by a minimum of 6 nautical miles along voyage tracks, are used together with the measured albedos for each ice type to assign an albedo to each visual observation, resulting in "ice-only" albedos as a function of latitude for each of five longitudinal sectors around Antarctica, for each of the four seasons. These ice albedos are combined with 13 yr of ice concentration estimates from satellite passive microwave measurements to obtain the geographical and seasonal variation of average surface albedo.

	abstract = {Melt pond covered sea ice is a ubiquitous feature of the summertime Arctic Ocean when meltwater collects in lower-lying areas of ice surfaces. Horizontal transects were conducted during June 2008 above and below landfast sea ice with melt ponds to characterize surface and bottom topography together with variations in transmitted spectral irradiance. We captured a rapid progression from a highly flooded sea ice surface with lateral drainage toward flaws and seal breathing holes to the formation of distinct melt ponds with steep edges. As the mass of the ice cover decreased due to meltwater drainage and rose upward with respect to the seawater level, the high-scattering properties of ice above the water level (i.e., white ice) were continuously regenerated, while pond waters remained transparent compared to underlying ice. The relatively stable albedos observed throughout the study, even as ice thickness decreased, were directly related to these surface processes. Transmission through the ice cover of incident irradiance in the 400-700 nm wave band ranged from 38\% to 67\% and from 5\% to 16\% beneath ponded and white ice, respectively. Our results show that this transmission varied not only as a function of surface type (melt ponds or white ice) areal coverage but also in relation to ice thickness and proximity to other surface types through the influence of horizontal spreading of light. Thus, in contrast to albedo, this implies that regional transmittance estimates need to consider melt pond size and shape distributions and variations in optical properties and thickness of the ice cover.

	abstract = {The influence of wave-current interactions on time series of marine X-band radar backscatter maps at the mouth of the Columbia River (MCR) near Astoria, Oregon, is examined. The energetic wave environment at the MCR, coupled with the strong tidally forced currents, provides a unique test environment to explore the limitations in accurately determining the magnitude and vertical structure of upper-ocean currents from wavefield measurements. Direct observation in time and space of the wave-induced radar backscatter and supporting acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) current measurements provide a rich dataset for investigating how currents shift the observed wave dispersion relationship. First, current extraction techniques that assume a specific current-depth profile are tested against ADCP measurements. These constrained solutions prove to have inaccuracies because the models do not properly account for vertical shear. A forward solution using measured current profiles to predict the wavenumber-Doppler shift relationship for the range of ocean waves sensed by the radar is introduced. This approach confirms the ocean wavefield is affected by underlying vertical current shear. Finally, a new inversion method is developed to extract current profiles from the wavenumber-dependent Doppler shift observations. The success of the inversion model is shown to be sensitive to the range of wavenumbers spanned by observed Doppler shifts, with skill exceeding 0.8 when wavenumbers span more than 0.1 rad m-1. This agreement when observations successfully capture the broadband wavefield suggests the X-band backscatter is a viable means of remotely estimating current shear.},

Using unique massive drifter releases during the Lagrangian Submesoscale Experiment (LASER) campaign in the Gulf of Mexico and the Coherent Lagrangian Pathways from the Surface Ocean to the Interior (CALYPSO) experiment in the Mediterranean Sea, we investigate the generation of submesoscale structures along two different mesoscale fronts. We use a novel method to project Lagrangian trajectories to Eulerian velocity fields, in order to calculate horizontal velocity gradients at the surface, which are used as a proxy for vertical transport. The velocity reconstruction uses a squared-exponential covariance function, which characterizes velocity correlations in horizontal space and time, and determines the scales of variation using the data itself. SST and towed CTD measurements support the findings revealed by the drifter data. Due to the production of a submesoscale instability eddy in the Gulf of Mexico, convergence magnitudes of up to ∼20 times the planetary vorticity, f, are observed, the value of which is almost 3 times larger than that found in the mesoscale dominated Western Mediterranean Sea.},

	abstract = {The drift velocity U0 at the interface between two homogeneous turbulent fluids of arbitrary relative densities in differential mean motion is considered. It is shown that an analytical expression for U0 follows from the classical scaling for these flows when the scaling is supplemented by standard turbulent universality and symmetry assumptions. This predicted U0 is the weighted mean of the free-stream velocities in each fluid, where the weighting factors are the square roots of the densities of the two fluids, normalized by their sum. For fluids of nearly equal densities, this weighted mean reduces to the simple mean of the free-stream velocities. For fluids of two widely differing densities, such as air overlying water, the result gives U0 ≈ αV∞, where α ≪ 1 is the square root of the ratio of the fluid densities, V∞ is the free-stream velocity of the overlying fluid, and the denser fluid is assumed nearly stationary. Comparisons with two classical laboratory experiments for fluids in these two limits and with previous numerical simulations of flow near a gas-liquid interface provide specific illustrations of the result. Solutions of a classical analytical model formulated to reproduce the air-water laboratory flow reveal compensating departures from the universality prediction, of order 15\% in α, including a correction that is logarithmic in the ratio of dimensionless air and water roughness lengths. Solutions reproducing the numerical simulations illustrate that the logarithmic correction can arise from asymmetry in the dimensionless laminar viscous sublayers.},

To study the mechanisms for the wave-induced airflow, we develop a viscous model by linearising the phase-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations in the mapped computational curvilinear coordinate. To illustrate the flow dynamics, we split into an antisymmetric component and a symmetric component. The solution of the antisymmetric component of from the viscous curvilinear model agrees well with the LES results for different opposing wave conditions. According to the viscous curvilinear model, the large-magnitude antisymmetric component of is driven by the wave kinematics at the surface and amplified by the mean shear and viscous stress in the air, and it causes the strong symmetric components of and. In contrast, the small-magnitude symmetric component of is forced by the antisymmetric through viscous and turbulent stresses near the surface, and it can be described by a further simplified inviscid curvilinear model away from the surface.

	abstract = {The turbulent flow over monochromatic waves of moderate steepness is studied by means of wall resolved large eddy simulations. The simulations cover a range of wave ages and Reynolds numbers. At low wave ages the form drag is highly sensitive to Reynolds number changes, and the interaction between turbulent and wave-induced stresses increases with Reynolds number. At higher wave ages, the flow enters a quasi-laminar regime where wave-induced stresses are primarily balanced by viscous stresses, and the form drag displays a simple Reynolds number dependence. To exploit the quasi-laminar response to the wave kinematics, we split the flow field into a laminar wave-generated response and a turbulent shear flow. The former is driven by the non-homogeneous boundary conditions, whereas the latter is driven by the laminar solution as well as turbulent stresses. For high wave ages, the splitting enables approximate functional dependencies for the form drag to be formulated. In the low wave age regime, where the wave-induced stresses are tightly connected with higher harmonics in the turbulent stresses, the flow is more challenging to analyse. Nevertheless, the importance of higher harmonics in the turbulent stresses can be quantified by explicitly choosing which modes to include in the split-system forcing.},

	abstract = {The optical properties of sea ice exhibit considerable spatial, temporal, and spectral variability. During a field experiment at Barrow, Alaska, we examined the horizontal variability of spectral albedo and transmittance as well as the vertical variability of in-ice radiance. Temporal changes were monitored under cold conditions in April and during the onset of melt in June. Physical properties, including ice structure and concentrations of particulate and dissolved material, were measured to provide a context for understanding the observed temporal, horizontal, vertical, and spectral variability in optical properties. For snow-covered first-year ice in April, wavelength-integrated (300-3000 nm) albedos were high (0.8) and spatially uniform, but there was considerable variability in transmittance. Transmittance at 440 nm ranged by more than a factor of 2 over horizontal distances of only 25 m, owing primarily to differences in snow depth, although spectral variations in transmittance indicate that absorbing organic materials in the ice column contribute significantly to the horizontal variability. Peak values of transmittance in April were 1\% near 500 nm, decreasing at both longer and shorter wavelengths. At the onset of melt in June, the ice surface rapidly evolved into a variegated mixture of melting snow, bare ice, and melt ponds. Albedos were much lower and exhibited considerable spatial variability, ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 over distances of a few meters concomitant with the variation in surface characteristics. Transmission increased over the spring transition as surface characteristics evolved to decrease albedo and as in-ice structure was altered by heating to reduce attenuation within the ice. The exception to this trend occurred over a period of a few days when an algal bloom developed on the underside of the ice and transmission was significantly reduced. Variability in the in-ice spectral radiance values was observed between nearby sites in both first-year and multiyear ice. While the radiance measurements are strongly dependent on the incident solar radiance, under similar solar conditions there was an observed shift in the peak of the maximum in the spectral radiance from 460 nm in clean ice to between 500 and 550 nm in ice that contained particulates in the surface layer. More impressive spectral shifts were found in an old melt pond that had accumulated particles at its base. Not only was there a strong shift in the spectral nature of the radiance as a function of horizontal distance, but there also existed large changes vertically within the ice. The vertical variability in the radiance attenuation coefficient was spatially coherent with variations in both the physical structure of the ice, especially grain size, and the concentrations of particulate and dissolved materials entrapped in the ice. Not surprisingly, the short-lived algal layer on the underside of the ice resulted in changes in the radiance attenuation coefficient from approximately 1m-1 in the interior ice to approximately 40m-1 within that layer.},

	abstract = {In an introductory section we review the physical processes influencing the formation and evolution of melt ponds on sea ice during the Arctic summer. As melt progresses, the changing properties of the surface interact strongly with the surface heat balance. The small interannual variability of the seasonal ice extent suggests an interannual variability of the surface heat balance of ±1 W m-2 or less. The interannual variance of atmospheric forcing represented by the transport of moist static energy into the Arctic is an order of magnitude greater. This appears to contradict the notion of a highly sensitive sea ice cover and emphasizes the need to generate albedo as an important internal variable in interactive models. Observations of melt ponds are needed in order to derive improved relationships between surface albedo and parameters such as the amount of snow, the onset and termination of melting, the ice thickness distribution, and ice deformation. Here classified (National Technical Means) imagery is used to measure melt pond coverage as it evolves over a summer on ice surrounding a drifting buoy. Local variability of pond cover is greatest at the beginning of the melt season, that is, pond coverage from 5\% to 50\% depending on ice type, as previously found by Russian investigators. An important distinction is found in the temporal change of pond cover: it decreases with time on thick ice, and it increases with time on thin ice (eventually leading to the disappearance of thin ice at the end of summer). An attempt to relate pond coverage to ice concentrations derived from passive microwave data proved unsuccessful.},

	abstract = {Solar radiation drives the melting of Arctic sea ice in summer, but its parameterization in thermodynamic modeling is difficult due to the large variability of the optical properties of sea ice in space and time. Here, a two-stream radiative transfer model was developed for the propagation of solar radiation in ponded sea ice to investigate the dependence of apparent optical properties (AOPs), particularly albedo and transmittance, on sky conditions, pond depth, ice thickness, and the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of ice and water. The results of numerical experiments revealed that decrease in melt-pond albedo during melting results not only from increase in pond depth but also from decrease in underlying ice thickness, and the latter is more important for thin ice with thickness less than 1.5 m. Hence, a parameterized pond albedo as a function of both pond depth and ice thickness is more suitable for thinning Arctic sea ice than the previously used exponential function of pond depth, which is valid for thicker ice. The increase in broadband transmittance during melting can be explained by the decrease in underlying ice thickness, because its dependence on ice thickness is nearly three times stronger than on pond depth. The spectral dependence of the pond albedo on depth is significant only in the 600-900-nm band, while it depends clearly on ice thickness in the 350-600-nm band. The uncertainty resulting from the absorption coefficient of ice is limited, while the effect of scattering in ice is more important, as determined by a sensitivity study on the influence of the IOPs on the AOPs of sea ice. The two-stream model provides a time-efficient parameterization of the AOPs for ponded sea ice, accounting for both absorption and scattering, and has potential for implementation into sea-ice thermodynamic models to explain the role of melt ponds in the summer decay of Arctic sea ice.},

A first step was made towards the parameterization of the lead-induced turbulence for high-resolution, but non-eddy resolving models. Progress has also been made with the parameterization of the near-surface atmospheric fluxes of energy and momentum modified by sea ice pressure ridges and by ice floe edges. Other studies brought new insight into the complex processes influencing sea ice transport and atmospheric stability over sea ice. Improved understanding was obtained on the cloud effects on the snow/ice surface temperature and further on the near-surface turbulent fluxes.

	abstract = {Abstract. Very near surface ocean currents are dominated by wind and wave forcing and have large impacts on the transport of buoyant materials in the ocean, but have proved difficult to measure with many modern instrumentations. Here, observations of ocean currents at two depths within the first meter of the surface are made utilizing trajectory data from both drogued and undrogued CARTHE drifters, which have draft depths of 60\&thinsp;cm and 5\&thinsp;cm, respectively. Trajectory data of dense, co-located drogued and undrogued drifters, were collected during the LAgrangian Submesoscale ExpeRiment (LASER) that took place from January to March of 2016 in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Examination of the drifter velocities reveals that the surface currents become strongly wind- and wave-driven during periods of high wind, with the pre-existing regional circulation having a smaller, but non-negligible, influence on the total surface velocity. During these high wind events, we deconstruct the full surface current velocities captured by each drifter type into their wind- and wave-driven components after subtracting an estimate for the regional circulation which pre-exists each wind event. In order to capture the regional circulation in the absence of strong wind and wave forcing, a Lagrangian variational method is used to create hourly velocity fields for both drifter types separately, during the hours preceding each high wind event. Synoptic wind and wave output data from the Unified Wave INterface\&ndash;Coupled Model (UWIN\&ndash;CM), a fully coupled atmosphere, wave and ocean circulation model, are used for analysis. The wind-driven component of the surface current exhibits a rotation to the right with depth between the two surface layers measured. We find that the averaged wind-driven surface current from 0\&ndash;5\&thinsp;cm (0\&ndash;60\&thinsp;cm) travels at {\textasciitilde}\&thinsp;3.4\&ndash;6.0\&thinsp;\% ({\textasciitilde}\&thinsp;2.3\&ndash;4.1\&thinsp;\%) of the wind speed, and is deflected {\textasciitilde}\&thinsp;5\&deg;\&ndash;55\&deg; ({\textasciitilde}\&thinsp;30\&ndash;85\&deg;) to the right of the wind, reaching higher deflection angles at higher wind speeds. Results provide new insight to the vertical shear present in wind-driven surface currents under high winds, which have vital implications for any surface transport problem.},

Here, we use field observations to describe this impact and measure the very near-surface current response to rainfall. During heavy rain, surface-roughening ring waves were generated and longer gravity waves were suppressed; immediately following, the magnitude of the near-surface current increased in response to wind forcing, but died as the rain subsided and long waves recovered. These first-of-their-kind field observations indicate that rain reduces ocean wave form drag in favor of tangential stress, resulting in the acceleration of current near the sea surface.},

We compare oil drift simulations (OpenOil), applying various configurations of wind, wave, and current information, with the observed slicks' positions and shape. We describe trajectories and dynamics of the spills, slick extent, and their evolution, and the differences in detection capabilities in optical instruments vs. multi-frequency PolSAR acquired by DLR's F-SAR. When using the best available forcing from in-situ data and forecast models, a good agreement with observed position and extent was found. A fair agreement is obtained using only numerical forecast data as input. This case study reveals that the accuracy when using modeled current is relatively higher after one full local inertial period, as the effect of incorrectly modeled amplitude of the inertial current is then vanishing. This should be a general result applicable to any oceanic drift forecast based on modeled current. A novelty is the comparison of viscous-similar soybean and mineral oil. Our findings indicate that biological oil emulsions potentially could replace mineral oil emulsions in contingency and rehearsal campaigns, but this finding is only supported from an oil drift prediction perspective. Differences in mineral oil detection capabilities are found between SAR and optical imagery of thinner sheen regions. F-SAR appears to be more sensitive to thinner oil and detect a larger extent, and differences between the thinner and thicker parts are observed.},

	abstract = {Historically, our understanding of the air-sea surface stress has been derived from engineering studies of turbulent flows over flat solid surfaces, and more recently, over rigid complex geometries. Over the ocean however, the presence of a free, deformable, moving surface gives rise to a more complicated drag formulation. In fact, within the constant-stress turbulent atmospheric boundary layer over the ocean, the total air-sea stress not only includes the traditional turbulent and viscous components but also incorporates surface-wave effects such as wave growth or decay, air-flow separation, and surface separation in the form of sea-spray droplets. Because each individual stress component depends on and alters the sea state, a simple linear addition of all stress components is too simplistic. In this paper we present a model of the air-sea surface stress that incorporates air-flow separation and its effects on the other stress components, such as a reduction of the surface viscous stress in the separated region as suggested by recent measurements. Naturally, the inclusion of these effects leads to a non-linear stress formulation. This model, which uses a variable normalized dissipation rate of breaking waves and normalized length of the separation bubble, reproduces the observed features of the drag coefficient from low to high wind speeds despite extrapolating empirical wave spectra and breaking wave statistics beyond known limits. The model shows the saturation of the drag coefficient at high wind speeds for both field and laboratory fetches, suggesting that air-flow separation over ocean waves and its accompanying effects may play a significant role in the physics of the air-sea stress, at least at high wind speeds. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

	abstract = {The air–sea momentum exchanges in the presence of surface waves play an integral role in coupling the atmosphere and the ocean. In the current study, we present a detailed laboratory investigation of the momentum fluxes over wind-generated waves. Experiments were performed in the large wind-wave facility at the Air–Sea Interaction Laboratory of the University of Delaware. Airflow velocity measurements were acquired above wind waves using a combination of particle image velocimetry and laser-induced fluorescence techniques. The momentum budget is examined using a wave-following orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. In the wave boundary layer, the phase-averaged turbulent stress is intense (weak) and positive downwind (upwind) of the crests. The wave-induced stress is also positive on the windward and leeward sides of wave crests but with asymmetric intensities. These regions of positive wave stress are intertwined with regions of negative wave stress just above wave crests and downwind of wave troughs. Likewise, at the interface, the viscous stress exhibits along-wave phase-locked variations with maxima upwind of the wave crests. As a general trend, the mean profiles of the wave-induced stress decrease to a negative minimum from a near-zero value far from the surface and then increase rapidly to a positive value near the interface where the turbulent stress is reduced. Far away from the surface, however, the turbulent stress is nearly equal to the total stress. Very close to the surface, in the viscous sublayer, the wave and turbulent stresses vanish, and therefore the stress is supported by the viscosity.},

These correspond to the following mean values (± standard deviations) of neutral transfer coefficients reduced to 10 m height, CDN10 = (1.9 ± 0.8) ? 10?3, CHN10 = (0.9 ± 0.3) ? 10?3, and CEN10 = (1.0 ± 0.2) ? 10?3. An average ratio of z0/zT ≈ 104 was observed over the range of 10?6 m {\textless} z0 {\textless} 10?2 m and differs from previously published results over compact sea ice (10?1 {\textless} z0/zT {\textless} 103). Other observational results over heterogeneous sea ice do not exist. However, our z0/zT ratio approximately agrees with observations over heterogeneous land surfaces. Flux parameterizations based on commonly used roughness lengths ratios (z0 = zT = zq) overestimate the surface heat fluxes compared to our measurements by more than 100\%.},

	abstract = {The small-scale physics within the first centimetres above the wavy air–sea interface are the gateway for transfers of momentum and scalars between the atmosphere and the ocean. We present an experimental investigation of the surface wind stress over laboratory wind-generated waves. Measurements were performed at the University of Delaware's large wind-wave-current facility using a recently developed state-of-the-art wind-wave imaging system. The system was deployed at a fetch of 22.7 m, with wind speeds from 2.19 to \$16.63{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}textrm \{m\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}textrm \{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ . Airflow velocity fields were acquired using particle image velocimetry above the wind waves down to \$100{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm \{{\textbackslash}mu \}{\textbackslash}textrm \{m\}\$ above the surface, and wave profiles were detected using laser-induced fluorescence. The airflow intermittently separates downwind of wave crests, starting at wind speeds as low as \$2.19{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}textrm \{m\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}textrm \{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ . Such events are accompanied by a dramatic drop in tangential viscous stress past the wave's crest, and a gradual regeneration of the viscous sublayer upon the following (downwind) crest. This contrasts with non-airflow separating waves, where the surface viscous stress drop is less significant. Airflow separation becomes increasingly dominant with increasing wind speed and wave slope \$a k\$ (where \$a\$ and \$k\$ are peak wave amplitude and wavenumber, respectively). At the highest wind speed ( \$16.63{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}textrm \{m\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}textrm \{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ ), airflow separation occurs over nearly 100 \% of the wave crests. The total air–water momentum flux is partitioned between viscous stress and form drag at the interface. Viscous stress (respectively form drag) dominates at low (respectively high) wave slopes. Tangential viscous forcing makes a minor contribution ( \$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ ) to wave growth.},

This is equivalent to solving the Rayleigh stability equation with linearized free-surface boundary condition for each sought point on the curve. Taking advantage of the analyticity of the dispersion relation, a path-following or continuation approach is adopted. The problem is discretized using a collocation scheme, parametrized along either a radial or angular path in the wave vector plane, and differentiated to yield a system of ODEs. After an initial eigenproblem solve using QZ decomposition, numerical integration proceeds along the curve using linear solves as the Runge–Kutta \$\$F({\textbackslash}cdot )\$\$F(·) function; thus, many QZ decompositions on a size 2N companion matrix are exchanged for one QZ decomposition and a small number of linear solves on a size N matrix. A piecewise interpolant provides dense output. The integration represents a nominal setup cost whereafter very many points can be computed at negligible cost whilst preserving high accuracy. Furthermore, a two-dimensional interpolant suitable for scattered data query points in the wave vector plane is described. Finally, a comparison is made with existing numerical methods for this problem, revealing that the path-following scheme is the most competitive algorithm for this problem whenever calculating more than circa 1,000 data points or relative normwise accuracy better than \$\$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$\$10-4 is sought.},

Observed ring waves on a still surface with sub-surface shear current are strikingly asymmetric, an effect of strongly anisotropic wave dispersion. Ship waves for motion across a sub-surface current on a still surface exhibit striking asymmetry about the ship's line of motion, and large differences in transverse wavelength for upstream versus downstream motion are demonstrated, all of which is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Neither of these phenomena can occur on a depth-uniform current. A quantitative comparison of measured versus predicted average phase shift for a ring wave is grossly mispredicted by no-shear theory, but in good agreement with predictions for the measured shear current. A clear difference in wave frequency within the ring wave packet is observed in the upstream versus downstream direction for all shear flows, while wave dispersive behaviour is identical to that for quiescent water for propagation normal to the shear current, as expected. Peak values of the measured two-dimensional Fourier spectrum for ship waves are shown to agree well with the predicted criterion of stationary ship waves, with the exception of some cases where results are imperfect due to the limited wavenumber resolution, transient effects and/or experimental noise. Experiments were performed on controlled shear currents created in two different ways, with a curved mesh and beneath a blocked stagnant-surface flow. Velocity profiles were measured with particle image velocimetry, and surface waves with a synthetic schlieren method. Our observations lend strong empirical support to recent predictions that wave forces on vessels and structures can be greatly affected by shear in estuarine and tidal waters.},

The method is straightforward to implement and starts from the existing state-of-the-art technique of assigning effective depths to measured wavenumber-dependent Doppler shift velocities. A polynomial fit is performed, with the coefficients scaled based on a simple derived relation to produce a current profile that is an improved estimate of the true profile. The method involves no user-input parameters, with the optimal parameters involved in the polynomial fit being chosen based on a simple criterion involving the measured Doppler shift data only. The method is tested on experimental data obtained from a laboratory where current profiles of variable depth dependence could be created and measured by particle image velocimetry, which served as “truth” measurements. Applying the new inversion method to experimentally measured Doppler shifts resulted in a {\textgreater}3 times improvement in accuracy relative to the state of the art for current profiles with significant near-surface curvature. The experiments are dynamically similar to typical oceanographic flows such as wind-drift profiles, and our laboratory thus makes a suitable and eminently useful scale model of the real-life setting. Our results show that the new method can achieve improved accuracy in reconstructing near-surface shear profiles from wave measurements by a simple extension of methods, which are currently in use, incurring little extra complexity and effort. A novel adaptation of the normalized scalar product method has been implemented, able to extract Doppler shift velocities as a function of wavenumber from the measured wave spectrum.},

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the air-sea momentum flux plays a critical role in ocean-atmosphere modeling. In this study we investigate the momentum flux budget at an air-water interface in the presence of wind-driven gravity-capillary waves. At the air-sea interface the total momentum flux (wind stress) partitions into viscous and wave-induced stress; the latter transfers momentum into surface waves. We estimate the wave growth rate (momentum transfer rate into waves) to close the momentum flux budget, using previous laboratory measurements of total and viscous stress, as well as surface wave spectra. The wave-induced stress is computed via a parameterized wave growth rate, which is proportional to the turbulent stress divided by the wave-phase speed squared. The constant of proportionality is then determined under two different assumptions. The first assumption (nonsheltering assumption) is that the turbulent stress is equal to the total wind stress. In the second assumption (sheltering assumption) the wave growth rate is determined by the local turbulent stress, which is a reduced turbulent stress due to the presence of longer waves. Both assumptions yield simple closed form expressions for the stress-partitioning ratio (ratio between the total stress and the viscous stress). With the sheltering assumption the growth rate agrees with previous theoretical and empirical estimates. Without sheltering, the growth rate is significantly lower than previous estimates. Therefore our results indicate that the growth rate of surface waves is determined by the local, reduced turbulent stress rather than the total wind stress.

The approach is based on the conservation of momentum in the marine atmospheric surface boundary layer and allows to relate the sea drag to the properties of the sea surface and the properties of the momentum exchange at the sea surface. Assumptions concerning the local balance of the turbulent kinetic energy production due to the mean and the wave-induced motions, and its dissipation, as well as the local balance between production and dissipation of the mean wave-induced energy allow to reduce the problem to two integral equations: the resistance law above waves and the coupling parameter, which are effectively solved by iterations. To calculate the wave-induced flux, the relation of Plant [1982] for the growth rate parameter is used. However, it is shown by numerical simulations that the local friction velocity rather than the total friction velocity has to be used in this relation, which makes the growth rate parameter dependent on the coupling parameter. It is shown that for light to moderate wind a significant part of the surface stress is supported by viscous drag. This is in good agreement with direct measurements under laboratory conditions. The short gravity and capillary-gravity waves play a significant role in extracting momentum and are strongly coupled with the atmosphere. This fact dictates the use of the coupled short waves-atmosphere model in the description of the energy balance of those waves. Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract = {Predicting the trajectories of buoyant objects drifting at the ocean surface is important for a variety of different applications. To minimize errors in predicted trajectories, the dominant transport mechanisms have to be considered. In addition to the background surface currents (i.e., geostrophic, tidal, baroclinic currents), the wind-driven drift current can have a significant influence on the dynamics of buoyant objects. The drift current consists of two components: Stokes drift and a wind-induced shear current. The drift current has a strong vertical profile that can have a large influence on the transport of buoyant objects. However, few practical methods exist that consider the vertical profile of the drift current when predicting particle pathways on the ocean surface. The aim of this paper is to introduce a depth-dependent drift current correction factor (“drift factor”). We test the usefulness of this drift factor by simulating the transport of two types of ocean surface drifters, released simultaneously within the coverage of a high-frequency ocean radar (HFR) system. Our results show velocity differences between the two types of drifters and the HFR measured ocean surface currents. We suggest that these differences are the result of the drift current vertical profile. Our particle tracking simulations provide an illustrative example, indicating the importance of accounting for a drift factor that takes the variation of the drift current with depth into account.},

	abstract = {It is shown how the drag of the sea surface can be computed from the wind speed and the sea state. The approach, applicable both for fully developed and for developing seas, is based on conservation of momentum in the boundary layer above the sea, which allows one to relate the drag to the properties of the momentum exchange between the sea waves and the atmosphere. The total stress is split into two parts: a turbulent part and a wave-induced part. The former is parameterized in terms of mixing-length theory. The latter is calculated by integration of the wave-induced stress over all wave numbers. Usually, the effective roughness is given in terms of the empirical Charnock relation. Here, it is shown how this relation can be derived from the dynamical balance between turbulent and wave-induced stress. To this end, the non-slip boundary conditions is assigned to the wave surface, and the local roughness parameter is determined by the scale of the molecular sublayer. The formation of the sea drag is then described for fully developed and developing seas and for light to high winds. For the Charnock constant, a value of about 0.018-0.030 is obtained, depending on the wind input, which is well within the range of experimental data. It is shown that gravity-capillary waves with a wavelength less than 5 cm play a minor role in the momentum transfer from wind to waves. Most of the momentum is transferred to decimeter and meter waves, so that the drag of developing seas depends crucially on the form of the wave spectrum in the corresponding high wavenumber range. The dependence of the drag on wave age depends sensitively on the dependence of this high wavenumbertail on wave age. If the tail is wave-age independent, the sea drag appears to be virtually independent of wave age. If the tail depends on wave age, the drag also does. There is contradictory evidence as to the actual dependence. Therefore, additional experiments are needed. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

	issn = {1745-2473},
	doi = {10.1038/s41567-020-0935-4},
	abstract = {U ndulation is an evolutionarily ancient locomotor pattern used by many long-bodied animals for propulsion in fluids and in terrestrial environments. Animals use environment-dependent patterns of axial bending that enable the body to push against the surrounding medium in a stable and efficient manner 1,2. Common wave patterns include lateral undulation on flat and rough surfaces 3-6 , sidewinding on sand 7,8 , viscous swimming at low Reynolds number 9-11 and inertial swimming at high Reynolds numbers 12-15. In contrast to the well understood role of aquatic and terrestrial undulation, the role of aerial undulation in limbless flyers is unknown. Flying snakes (Chrysopelea) are the only known limbless vertebrates capable of flight 16. When gliding, these animals use aerial undulation, moving horizontally downward through the air by converting gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy, producing aerodynamic lift and drag (Supplementary Videos 1-4). Their undulation is characterized by an S-shape body planform (Fig. 1), a low undulation frequency of 1-2 Hz, and a flattened, aerofoil-like body cross-section 17-21. Most glides begin with a jump, during which a wave of dorsoventral flattening passes from the head to the vent 22. This flattening transforms the snake's circular cross-section into a roughly triangular aerofoil, with favourable aerodynamic properties and gentle stall characteristics 23-25. Aerial undulation continuously reconfigures the snake's body, transforming the animal into a morphing wing (Fig. 1e). Previous studies of snake glides determined that flying snakes always undu-late while airborne. However, it is unclear if undulation is a functional requirement of gliding, or simply a behavioural remnant of snake locomotion, as all snakes are capable of lateral undulation, an evolutionary ancient motor pattern produced by waves of muscle contraction propagating down the body 26. Some non-flying snakes react to dropping by undulating (J.J.S., personal observation). Previous measurements of aerial undulation under-resolved the animal's body, making it difficult to quantify the time-varying body configuration. This lack of resolution has previously limited our ability to test how aerial undulation affects flight dynamics and reveal the mechanical function of aerial undulation 17,19,20. From analogy with terrestrial and aquatic undulation, one might expect that aerial undulation generates propulsive thrust. On solid media, undulatory locomotion occurs due to distributed contact forces over ventral and lateral regions of the body, and in water, the fluid displacement or suction along the body causes forward motion 27. In both cases, the net propulsive thrust acts predominantly within the plane of undulation. Modulation of the body out of plane (in the vertical direction) may be used for secondary purposes, such as reducing drag or increasing the normal force 4,8. Forward motion stops when undulation stops, and because of the body's distributed contact area and neutral buoyancy, rotational stability is not a primary concern. For flying snakes, a successful glide requires generation of aerodynamic forces to offset the animal's weight. Lift and drag forces are produced by air flowing over the flattened body as it accelerates downward under gravity, with the reciprocating motion produced by muscular contractions probably not enhancing force production 19. The resulting aerodynamic forces should act out of the plane of undu-lation; furthermore, undulation should continuously change the distribution of forces on the body. As flying snakes have two additional rotational degrees of freedom (about the pitch and roll axes) compared with terrestrial undulators 28 , time-varying forces should affect the rotational behaviour 29. These physical challenges of flight without wings, and the unique kinematics of flying snakes while airborne, suggest that aerial undulation does indeed have a functional role. Here, we investigate the functional role of aerial undulation in snake gliding flight by assessing its effects on flight dynamics. Using high-speed motion capture and a large indoor glide arena, we quantify aerial undulation to provide an understanding of the entire morphing wing-body. This higher-fidelity understanding of the body enables us to develop an anatomically accurate theoretical model of snake flight, which we combine with previous aerodynamic force measurements to test the performance and stability properties of aerial undulation in limbless flight. Our results provide a foundation for designing snake-inspired robots that use aerial undulation to glide through the air, adding to the growing library of robotic snake locomotion. Flying snakes use waves of orthogonal bending when gliding Aerial undulation consists of coupled waves of horizontal and vertical bending. We used high-speed motion capture to record the position of 11-17 landmarks placed along the body from seven When flying snakes glide, they use aerial undulation. To determine if aerial undulation is a flight control strategy or a non-functional behavioural vestige of lateral undulation, we measured snake glides using high-speed motion capture and developed a new dynamical model of gliding. Reconstructions of the snake's wing-body reveal that aerial undulation is composed of horizontal and vertical waves, whose phases differ by 90° and whose frequencies differ by a factor of two. Using these results, we developed a three-dimensional mathematical model of snake flight that incorporates aerodynamic and inertial effects. Although simulated glides without undulation attained some horizontal distance, they are biologically unrealistic because they failed due to roll and pitch instabilities. In contrast, the inclusion of undulation stabilized the rotational motion and markedly increased glide performance. This work demonstrates that aerial undulation in snakes serves a different function than known uses of undulation in other animals, and suggests a new template of control for dynamic flying robots.

	abstract = {The rise in Arctic near-surface air temperatures has been almost twice as large as the global average in recent decades1-3-a feature known as 'Arctic amplification'. Increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have driven Arctic and global average warming1,4; however, the underlying causes of Arctic amplification remain uncertain. The roles of reductions in snow and sea ice cover5-7 and changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation8-10, cloud cover and water vapour 11,12 are still matters of debate. A better understanding of the processes responsible for the recent amplified warming is essential for assessing the likelihood, and impacts, of future rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss13,14. Here we show that the Arctic warming is strongest at the surface during most of the year and is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover. Changes in cloud cover, in contrast, have not contributed strongly to recent warming. Increases in atmospheric water vapour content, partly in response to reduced sea ice cover, may have enhanced warming in the lower part of the atmosphere during summer and early autumn. We conclude that diminishing sea ice has had a leading role in recent Arctic temperature amplification. The findings reinforce suggestions that strong positive ice-temperature feedbacks have emerged in the Arctic15, increasing the chances of further rapid warming and sea ice loss, and will probably affect polar ecosystems, ice-sheet mass balance and human activities in the Arctic 2. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

As Earth approaches 2°C warming, the Arctic and Antarctic may reach 4°C and 2°C mean annual warming, and 7°C and 3°C winter warming, respectively. Expected consequences of increased Arctic warming include ongoing loss of land and sea ice, threats to wildlife and traditional human livelihoods, increased methane emissions, and extreme weather at lower latitudes. With low biodiversity, Antarctic ecosystems may be vulnerable to state shifts and species invasions. Land ice loss in both regions will contribute substantially to global sea level rise, with up to 3 m rise possible if certain thresholds are crossed. Mitigation efforts can slow or reduce warming, but without them northern high latitude warming may accelerate in the next two to four decades. International cooperation will be crucial to foreseeing and adapting to expected changes.},

It is shown that flow inclination of up to 30° is found over the escarpment, but attenuates within a few hundred metres downstream. The formation of a reattached boundary layer could be measured, as well as an increased turbulence intensity in the reattachment zone.

	abstract = {The meteorological mini unmanned aerial vehicle (M2AV) was used for measuring the meteorological wind. The wind is the vector difference between the aircraft speed relative to the earth (inertial velocity) and relative to the airflow (true airspeed). The latter was computed from five-hole-probe pressure measurements in combination with calibration-coefficient polynomials obtained during wind tunnel calibration. The aircraft inertial velocity, position, and attitude were calculated using a Kalman filter that combined data from a global positioning system (GPS) and an inertial navigation system (INS). The temporal (and spatial) resolution of the M2AV wind measurement is remarkably fine. An inertial subrange of locally isotropic turbulence can be measured up to 40 Hz (or 0.55 m at 22 m s-1 airspeed). The first M2AV wind estimation showed some systematic deviations compared to the expected values (like a constant mean wind in every flight direction). Therefore, an in-flight wind calibration technique was developed that corrects for the inaccuracy of the true heading, the constant offset of the pitch angle, and the underestimation of the true airspeed. The final adjusted wind measurements were verified during a field experiment at the measurement field of the German Meteorological Service, southeast of Berlin. The mean horizontal and vertical wind measured by the M2AV agreed well with simultaneous sodar and tower measurements. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Predicting the distribution of oil, buoyant plastics, flotsam, and marine organisms near the ocean surface remains a fundamental problem of practical importance. This manuscript synthesizes progress in this area during the time of the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI; 2012–2019), with an emphasis on the accumulation of floating material into highly concentrated streaks on horizontal scales of meters to 10's of kilometers. Prior to the GoMRI period, two new paradigms emerged: the importance of submesoscale frontal dynamics on the larger scales and of surface-wave-driven Langmuir turbulence on the smaller scales, with a broad transition occurring near 100 m. Rapid progress resulted from the combination of high resolution numerical modeling tools, mostly developed before GoMRI, and new observational techniques developed during GoMRI. Massive deployments of inexpensive and biodegradable satellite-tracked surface drifters combined with aerial tracking of oil surrogates (drift cards) enabled simultaneous observations of surface ocean velocities and dispersion over scales of 10 m to 10's of kilometers. Surface current maps produced by ship-mounted radar and aerial optical remote sensing systems, combined with traditional oceanographic tools, enabled a set of coordinated measurement programs that supported and expanded the new paradigms. Submesoscale fronts caused floating material to both accumulate at fronts and to disperse as they evolved, leading to higher local concentrations, but increased overall dispersion. Analyses confirmed the distinct submesoscale dynamics of this process and the complexity of the resulting fields. Existing tools could be developed into predictive models of submesoscale statistics, but prediction of individual submesoscale features will likely remain limited by data. Away from fronts, measured rates of accumulation of material in and beneath surface windrows was found to be consistent with Langmuir turbulence, but highly dependent on the rise rate of the material and thus, for oil, on the droplet size. Models of this process were developed and tested and could be further developed into predictive tools. Both the submesoscale and Langmuir processes are sensitive to coupling with surface waves and air-sea flux processes. This sensitivity is a promising area for future studies.},

The data are collected by the multirotor aircraft hovering 10 m above ground adjacent to one or more sonic anemometers. Wind speed and direction show good agreement with sonic anemometer measurements in the initial experiments. Typical errors in wind speed and direction are smaller than 0.5 ms-1 and 30°, respectively. Multirotor aircraft provide a promising alternative to traditional platforms for vertical profiling in the atmospheric boundary layer, especially in conditions where a tethered balloon system is typically deployed.},

We present a machine learning approach to wind velocity estimation based on quadcopter state measurements without a wind sensor. We accomplish this by training a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network (NN) on roll and pitch angles and quadcopter position inputs with forcing wind velocities as the targets. The datasets are generated using a simulated quadcopter in turbulent wind fields. The trained neural network is deployed to estimate the turbulent winds as generated by the Dryden gust model as well as a realistic large eddy simulation (LES) of a near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over flat terrain. The resulting NN predictions are compared to a wind triangle approach that uses tilt angle as an approximation of airspeed. Results from this study indicate that the LSTM-NN based approach predicts lower errors in both the mean and variance of the local wind field as compared to the wind triangle approach. The work reported in this article demonstrates the potential of machine learning for sensor-less wind estimation and has strong implications to large-scale low-altitude atmospheric sensing using sUAS for environmental and autonomous navigation applications.},

Here, properties of gravity waves are investigated from a fixed platform in the Black Sea, equipped with a stereo video system that resolves waves with frequency f up to 1.4 Hz and wavelengths from 0.6 to 11 m. One representative record is analyzed, corresponding to young wind waves with a peak frequency fp 5 0.33 Hz and a wind speed of 13 m s21. These measurements allow for a separation of the linear waves from the bound second-order harmonics. These harmonics are negligible for frequencies fup to 3 times fp but account for most of the energy at higher frequencies. The full spectrum is well described by a combination of linear components and the second-order spectrum. In the range 2fp to 4fp, the full frequency spectrum decays like f25, which means a steeper decay of the linear spectrum. The directional spectrum exhibits a very pronounced bimodal distribution, with two peaks on either side of the wind direction, separated by 1508 at 4fp. This large separation is associated with a significant amount of energy traveling in opposite directions and thus sources of underwater acoustic and seismic noise. The magnitude of these sources can be quantified by the overlap integral I( f), which is found to increase sharply from less than 0.01 at f5 2fp to 0.11 at f5 4fp and possibly up to 0.2 at f5 5fp, close to the 0.5p value proposed in previous studies.},

	abstract = {A theory is given for the non-linear transfer of energy from gravity waves on water to capillary waves. When a progressive gravity wave approaches its maximum steepness it develops a sharp crest, at which the surface tension must be locally important. This gives rise to a travelling disturbance which produces a train of capillary waves ahead of the crest, i.e. on the foward face of the gravity wave. The capillary waves, once formed, then take further energy from the gravity wave through the radiation stresses, at the same time losing energy by viscosity. The steepness of the capillary waves is calculated and found to be in substantial agreement with some observations by C. S. Cox. An approximate expression for the ripple steepness near the crest of the gravity wave is [formula omitted] where T' is the surface tension constant and K is the curvature at the wave crest. The ripple steepness also varies with distance from the wave crest. Under favourable circumstances the dissipation of energy by the capillary waves can be many times the dissipation in the gravity waves. The capillary waves may therefore play a significant role in the generation of waves by wind, in that they tend to delay the onset of breaking. © 1963, Cambridge University Press.

	abstract = {The angular momentum A per unit horizontal distance of a train of periodic, progressive surface waves is a well-defined quantity, independent of the horizontal position of the origin of moment. The Lagrangian-mean angular momentum L consists of two parts, arising from the orbital motion and from the Stokes drift respectively. Together these contribute a positive sum, nearly proportional to the energy density (when the origin is taken in the mean surface level). If moments are taken about some point P not at the mean surface level, the angular momentum will differ by an amount proportional to the elevation of P. There is just one elevation for which the Lagrangian-mean angular momentum about P vanishes. This elevation is called the level of action. For infinitesimal waves in deep water the level of action is at a height above the mean surface equal to 1/2k, that is 1/4 times the wavelength. Just as for ordinary fluid velocities, the Lagrangian-mean angular momentum AL differs from the Eulerian-mean L, the latter being zero to second order. The difference between L and E is associated with the displacement of the lateral boundaries of any given mass of fluid. For waves of finite amplitude, an initially rectangular mass of fluid becomes ultimately quite distorted by the Stokes drift. Nevertheless it is possible to define a longtime average l.t. Ā and to calculate its numerical value accurately in waves of finite amplitude. In low waves, l.t. Ā is equal to L. Defining the level of action ya in the general case as l.t.Ā, where I is the linear momentum, we find that ya rises from 05k-1 for infinitesimal waves to about 06k-1 for steep waves. Thus ya is about the same as the height ymax of the wave crests above the mean level in limiting waves, a fact which may account for why steep irrotational waves can support whitecaps in a quasi-steady state. The same argument suggests that Gerstner waves (in which the particle orbits are theoretically circular) could not support whitecaps. © 1980, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The development of the governing equations for fluid flow in a surface-following coordinate system is essential to investigate the fluid flow near an interface deformed by propagating waves. In this paper, the governing equations of fluid flow, including conservation of mass, momentum and energy balance, are derived in an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system relevant to surface water waves. All equations are further decomposed to extract mean, wave-induced and turbulent components. The complete transformed equations include explicit extra geometric terms. For example, turbulent stress and production terms include the effects of coordinate curvature on the structure of fluid flow. Furthermore, the governing equations of motion were further simplified by considering the flow over periodic quasi-linear surface waves wherein the wavelength of the disturbance is large compared to the wave amplitude. The quasi-linear analysis is employed to express the boundary layer equations in the orthogonal wave-following curvilinear coordinates with the corresponding decomposed equations for the mean, wave and turbulent fields. Finally, the vorticity equations are also derived in the orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in order to express the corresponding velocity-vorticity formulations. The equations developed in this paper proved to be useful in the analysis and interpretation of experimental data of fluid flow over wind-generated surface waves.

	abstract = {As in a previous theory (Longuet-Higgins 1963) parasitic capillary waves are considered as a perturbation due to the local action of surface tension forces on an otherwise pure progressive gravity wave. Here the theory is improved by: (i) making use of our more accurate knowledge of the profile of a steep Stokes wave; (ii) taking account of the influence of gravity on the capillary waves themselves, through the effective gravitational acceleration g* for short waves riding on longer waves. Nonlinearity in the capillary waves themselves is not included, and certain other approximations are made. Nevertheless, the theory is shown to be in essential agreement with experiments by Cox (1958), Ebuchi, Kawamura \& Toba (1987) and Perlin, Lin \& Ting (1993). A principal result is that for gravity waves of a given length L ; 5 cm there is a critical steepness parameter (AK)C at which the surface velocity (in a frame of reference moving with the phase-speed) equals the minimum (local) speed of capillary-gravity waves. On subcritical gravity waves, with steepness AK {\textless} (AK)C, capillary waves may be generated at all points of the wave surface. On supercritical waves, with AK ; (AK)C, capillary waves can only be generated in the wave troughs; they are trapped between two caustics near the crests. Generally, the amplitude of the parasitic capillaries is greatest on gravity waves of near critical (but not maximum) steepness. © 1995, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

Based on a viscous boundary layer approximation near the surface, the model enables us to efficiently calculate gravity-capillary waves.

	abstract = {We present a study of nonlinear gravity-capillary waves with surface forcing and viscous dissipation. Based on a viscous boundary layer approximation near the water surface, the theory permits the efficient calculation of steady gravity-capillary waves with parasitic capillary ripples. To balance the viscous dissipation and thus achieve steady solutions, wind forcing is applied by adding a surface pressure distribution. For a given wavelength the properties of the solutions depend upon two independent parameters: the amplitude of the dominant wave and the amplitude of the pressure forcing. We find two main classes of waves for relatively weak forcing: Class 1 and Class 2. (A third class of solution requires strong forcing and is qualitatively different.) For Class 1 waves the maximum surface pressure occurs near the wave trough, while for Class 2 it is near the crest. The Class 1 waves are associated with Miles' (1957, 1959) mechanism of wind-wave generation, while the Class 2 waves may be related to instabilities of the subsurface shear current. For both classes of waves, steady solutions are possible only for forcing amplitudes greater than a certain threshold. We demonstrate how parasitic capillary ripples affect the dissipative and dispersive properties of the solutions. In particular, there may be a significant deviation from the linear phase speed for gravity-capillary waves. Also, wave damping is strongly enhanced by the parasitic capillaries (by as much as two orders of magnitude when compared to the case with no capillary waves). Preliminary experimental results from a wind-wave channel give good agreement with the theory. We find a sharp cut-off in the wavenumber spectra of the solutions which is similar to that observed in laboratory measurements of short gravity-capillary waves. Finally, for large wave amplitudes we find a sharp corner in the wave profile which may separate an overhanging wave crest from a train of parasitic capillaries.},

Their technique is based upon the determination of the pixel-by-pixel sea ice surface temperature from which estimates of sensible heat fluxes are then made. We compare the sensible heat fluxes over the Beaufort Sea computed using their methodology with those measured by a gust probe system on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration P-3 aircraft on April 18, 1992, during the Leads Experiment. We use an AVHRR image recorded during the P-3 flight at 2303 UTC. We show that individual lead heat fluxes can be large, 115 W m?2 for 1-km average fluxes obtained from flight legs that included a 300-m-wide lead, but that regional values of sensible flux over 50?200 km of sea ice were small and positive, ?8 W m?2. The sensible heat flux computed from the P-3 showed that a value of CS = 1.1?10?3, where CS is the heat transfer coefficient relative to 10 m, is appropriate for the spring Beaufort Sea. We suggest that more realistic winds derived, for example, from the National Meteorological Center sea level pressure analyses be used instead of the constant value of 5 m s?1 now employed by Lindsay and Rothrock. We also found that the maximum value of ?T, the difference between air and surface temperature, used in the calculation of sensible heat flux using the Lindsay and Rothrock technique was underestimated by a factor of 1.9 when compared with direct measurements. Use of this ?T correction factor, synoptic scale winds, and the calculated value of CS gave a good comparison between the AVHRR approach and aircraft fluxes measured over the region. The effective regional momentum drag coefficient CD relative to 10 m was 2.1?10?3, typical of Arctic pack ice.},

Three profiles of momentum flux and mean wind were used to calculate an air-ice drag coefficient CD of 3.0 ± .6 ? 10?3 referenced to a 10-m anemometer height. The boundary layer was slightly unstable (zi/L = ?1.2, where zi, was the inversion height of 660 m and L the Monin-Obukhov length). The mean wind speed at the 42-m height was 17 m/s, and the air temperature was ?20°C.

The turning angle of the surface wind (measured by an anemometer at a height of 3 m on the ice) was 32°, and the ratio of surface wind speed to the geostrophic wind speed was 0.76.},

	abstract = {For a free-drift case a method is developed for simultaneously determining air (Ca) and water (Cw) drag coefficients by solving the vertically integrated stress balance equation for sea ice. The method allows the algebraic determination of Ca and Cw from measurements of relative wind and relative current at single reference levels, from estimates of the densities of all three fluids and ice thickness, and from estimates of the accelerations caused by the nonsurface stress terms derived from position measurements. The method treats the ice as a natural drag plate and therefore includes contributions from both skin and form drag. One shortcoming of the technique is that if the relative wind and current are colinear, then only the ratio of Ca and Cw can be determined. Another is that the accelerations caused by other forces need to be independently determined. An experiment was conducted on a single floe in the eastern Bering Sea over the continental shelf during March 1981. The site was about 80 km from the ice edge and was occupied for approximately 3 days following the passage of a storm which had broken the pack into 10?20 m diameter floes. Both profile and slab inversion estimates of drag were made from the current meter and anemometer measurements at the site: Ca at 3 m was 4.55?10?3 by the profile method, compared to 3.63?4.39?10?3 for slab, depending on assumptions; Cw at 1.1 m by profile was 24.2?10?3, compared to 18.3?22.0?10?3 for slab. The two methods gave results which were not statistically separable and which were among the highest drags observed for sea ice. The instantaneous stress balance on the floe included contributions from material acceleration, Coriolis force, the two surface stresses, and sea-surface tilt relative to mean current and tide.},

A shallow atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) was observed, which wasgradually cooling with distance downwind of the ice edge. This process was mainly connected with astrong stable stratification and downward turbulent heat fluxes of about 10–20 W m-2, but wasalso due to radiative cooling. Two mesoscale models, one hydrostatic and the other non-hydrostatic,having different turbulence closures, were applied. Despite these fundamental differences betweenthe models, the results of both agreed well with the observed data. Various closure assumptions had amore crucial influence on the results than the differences between the models.Such an assumption was, for example,the parameterization of the surface roughness for momentum (z0) and heat (zT). This stronglyaffected the wind and temperature fields not only close to the surface but also within and abovethe temperature inversion layer. The best results were achieved using a formulation for z0 that took intoaccount the form drag effect of sea-ice ridges together withzT = 0.1z0. The stability within theelevated inversion strongly depended on the minimum eddy diffusivity Kmin. A simple ad hocparameterization seems applicable, where Kmin is calculated as 0.005 timesthe neutral eddy diffusivity. Although the longwave radiative cooling was largest within the ABL, theapplication of a radiation scheme was less important there than above the ABL. This was related to theinteraction of the turbulent and radiative fluxes. To reproduce the strong inversion, it wasnecessary to use vertical and horizontal resolutions higher than those applied in most regional andlarge-scale atmospheric models.},

	abstract = {Sea ice topography significantly impacts turbulent energy/momentum exchange, e.g., atmospheric (wind) drag, over Arctic sea ice. Unfortunately, observational estimates of this contribution to atmospheric drag variability are spatially and temporally limited. Here we present new estimates of the neutral atmospheric form drag coefficient over Arctic sea ice in early spring, using high-resolution Airborne Topographic Mapper elevation data from NASA's Operation IceBridge mission. We utilize a new three-dimensional ice topography data set and combine this with an existing parameterization scheme linking surface feature height and spacing to form drag. To be consistent with previous studies investigating form drag, we compare these results with those produced using a new linear profiling topography data set. The form drag coefficient from surface feature variability shows lower values ({\textless}0.5?1 ?10?3) in the Beaufort/Chukchi Seas, compared with higher values ({\textgreater}0.5?1 ?10?3) in the more deformed ice regimes of the Central Arctic (north of Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago), which increase with coastline proximity. The results show moderate interannual variability, including a strong increase in the form drag coefficient from 2013 to 2014/2015 north of the Canadian Archipelago. The form drag coefficient estimates are extrapolated across the Arctic with Advanced Scatterometer satellite radar backscatter data, further highlighting the regional/interannual drag coefficient variability. Finally, we combine the results with existing parameterizations of form drag from floe edges (a function of ice concentration) and skin drag to produce, to our knowledge, the first pan-Arctic estimates of the total neutral atmospheric drag coefficient (in early spring) from 2009 to 2015.},

	abstract = {Abstract During March 1979 field observations in the Bering Sea show that because of the interaction of winds and ocean swell with the ice, the ice edge divides into three distinct zones. First, adjacent to the open ocean is an ?edge" zone, 1?15 km in width, which consists of heavily rafted and ridged floes with thicknesses of 1?5 m and measuring 10?20 m on a side. Second is a ?transition? zone measuring ?5 km in width, which consists of rectangular ice floes with thicknesses of ?0.5 m and measuring 20?40 m on a side. Third is the ?interior? zone, which extends over hundreds of kilometers and consists of very large, relatively flat floes with thicknesses of ?0.3 m. In the edge zone the incident swell causes the floes to fracture, raft and form pressure ridges, resulting in small thick floes. In the transition zone the swell amplitude is reduced to the point that the floes fracture in a rectangular pattern with very little rafting or ridging taking place. In the interior zone the swell amplitude is further reduced such that the waves propagate without fracturing the ice, so that the floes have horizontal dimensions of kilometers. Because of this ice distribution, when strong winds blow off the ice, bands of ice floes form at the ice edge. The reason bands form is that the edge zone ice has a large aerodynamic drag due to the heavy rafting and ridging, so that this ice moves downwind ahead of the rest of the pack. Once this ice moves away from the pack, the combination of aerodynamic drag plus the absorption of wind wave and swell energy leads to the band formation. We observed that these bands, which are on the order of 1 km wide and 10 km in length, move south into warmer water until they melt.},

Melt ponds accumulate on the surface of sea ice from snow and sea ice melt and their presence reduces the albedo of the ice cover, leading to further melt. Toward the end of the melt season, melt ponds cover up to 50\% of the sea ice surface. We have developed a melt pond evolution theory. Here, we have incorporated this melt pond theory into the Los Alamos CICE sea ice model, which has required us to include the refreezing of melt ponds. We present results showing that the presence, or otherwise, of a representation of melt ponds has a significant effect on the predicted sea ice thickness and extent. We also present a sensitivity study to uncertainty in the sea ice permeability, number of thickness categories in the model representation, meltwater redistribution scheme, and pond albedo. We conclude with a recommendation that our melt pond scheme is included in sea ice models, and the number of thickness categories should be increased and concentrated at lower thicknesses.},

The latter is analyzed on the basis of laser altimeter data obtained during airborne campaigns between 1995 and 2011 over more than 10,000 km of flight distance in different regions of the Arctic Ocean. Spectra of height and spacing between topographic features averaged over 10 km flight sections show that typical values are 0.45 m for the mean height and about 20 m for the mean spacing. Nevertheless, the variability is high and the spatial variability is stronger than the temporal one. The total topography spectrum is divided into a range with small obstacles (between 0.2 m and 0.8 m height) and large obstacles (≥0.8 m). Results show that large pressure ridges represent the dominant topographic feature only along the coast of Greenland. In the Central Arctic, the concentration of large ridges decreased over the years, accompanied by an increase of small obstacles concentration and this might be related to decreasing multiyear ice. The application of a topography-dependent parameterization of neutral atmospheric drag coefficients reflects the large variability in the sea-ice topography and reveals characteristic differences between the regions. Based on the analysis of the two spectral ranges, we find that the consideration of only large pressure ridges is not enough to characterize the roughness degree of an ice field, and the values of drag coefficients are in most regions strongly influenced by small obstacles.},

The drag partitioning concept pays attention to the probability density functions of the geometric surface parameters. We found for the marginal ice zone that the form drag, caused by floe edges, can amount to 140\% of the skin drag, while the effect of pressure ridges never exceeded 40\%. Due to the narrow spacing of obstacles, the skin drag is significantly reduced by shadowing effects on the leeward side of floe edges. For practical purposes, the fractional sea-ice coverage can be used to parameterize the drag coefficientCdn, related to the 10 m-wind.

Here the authors focus on the impact of on-ice atmospheric and oceanic flows at the sea ice edge. Mesoscale jet formation due to the Coriolis effect is well understood over sharp changes in surface roughness such as coastlines (Hunt et al.). This sharp change in surface roughness is experienced by the atmosphere and ocean encountering a compacted sea ice edge. This paper presents a study of a dynamic sea ice edge responding to prescribed atmospheric and oceanic jet formation. An idealized analytical model of sea ice drift is developed and compared to a sea ice climate model [the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE)] run on an idealized domain. The response of the CICE model to jet formation is tested at various resolutions.It is found that the formation of atmospheric jets at the sea ice edge increases the wind speed parallel to the sea ice edge and results in the formation of a sea ice drift jet in agreement with an observed sea ice drift jet (Johannessen et al.). The increase in ice drift speed is dependent upon the angle between the ice edge and wind and results in up to a 40\% increase in ice transport along the sea ice edge. The possibility of oceanic jet formation and the resultant effect upon the sea ice edge is less conclusive. Observations and climate model data of the polar oceans have been analyzed to show areas of likely atmospheric jet formation, with the Fram Strait being of particular interest.},

This is among the largest drag coefficients measured for neutral atmospheric conditions over sea ice. Sixty-five percent of the variance of this estimate is explained by orientation of the ice floe to the wind; an additional 5\% of the variance is explained by wind-speed dependence. Provided that diabatic atmospheric stability over the Bering Sea ice pack is well correlated with low wind speed, the significant ice-advecting wind stress on the ice is determined from the neutral value of the drag coefficient, a function of ice roughness length alone. The ice forecaster thus may use remote measurements or estimates of wind speed and surface roughness to assess the wind component of ice advection.},

Although the schemes are based on different principles (flux averaging and parameter averaging), the resulting drag coefficients differ only slightly in the case of neutral and stable stratification. For unstable stratification and sea-ice conditions being typical for the north-eastern Fram Strait, the drag coefficients resulting from the parameter-averaging concept are 5–10\% larger than those of the flux-averaging concept. At a sea-ice concentration of 45\%, the parameter-averaging method overestimates the heat fluxes by a factor of 1.2. An inclusion in the schemes of form drag caused by floe edges and ridges has a much larger effect on the drag coefficient, and on the momentum fluxes, than the choice between the parameter-averaging or flux-averaging methods. Based on sensitivity studies with the flux-averaging scheme, a simple formula for the effective drag coefficient above the Arctic MIZ is derived. It reduces the computational costs of the more complex parameterisations and could also be used in larger scale models. With this simple formula, the effective drag coefficient can be calculated as a function of the sea-ice concentration and skin drag coefficients for water and ice floes. The results obtained with this parameterisation differ only slightly from those using the more complex schemes. Finally, it is shown that in the MIZ, drag coefficients for sea-ice models may differ significantly from the effective drag coefficients used in atmospheric models.},

Sea-ice roughness is introduced as an additional prognostic variable in a dynamic?thermodynamic sea-ice model with a viscous-plastic rheology. It is defined as the accumulated work of internal forces acting upon an ice volume, given in energy per area. A fraction of this total deformation work is transferred to the potential energy stored in pressure ridges. Using ridge geometries and distribution functions from observations, observable quantities like mean pressure ridge height, ridge frequency as well as volumetric and areal fractions of deformed ice are derived from the simulated ice roughness. Comparisons of these simulated quantities with measurements (submarine-borne sonars, laser altimeters on helicopters) show good agreement. Satellite-borne observations of sea-ice roughness now under development will provide an even larger data set which will be used for model verification. Additionally roughness-dependent drag coefficients are introduced to account for the effect on the momentum exchange between ocean and atmosphere due to the form drag of roughness elements. The simulations indicate that the inclusion of sea-ice roughness provides for a more realistic representation of the boundary layer processes in climate models.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the air/sea drag coefficient for first-year ice from recent aircraft measurements and reconciles the range of observed drag coefficients (103CD = 1.2?3.7 referenced to 10 m) for all sea ice types, based on ice roughness and seasonal meteorology. For the purpose of sea ice modeling, it is necessary to define an effective drag coefficient which relates regional stress to regional wind, because sea ice is heterogeneous on scales less than 20 km. Regional stress is influenced by the distribution of surface roughness, the buoyancy flux from quasi-periodic leads, and external atmospheric conditions, principally the inversion height. 103CD is 1.3?1.5 for smooth ice but is much greater for nonflat surfaces. For wind speeds greater than 5 m/s and air temperatures below freezing, the effective 103CD is 2.5?3.0 for nearly continuous pack ice, such as first-year ice in seasonal ice zones and central Arctic basin. The range of values of 103CD is 3.0?3.7 for unstable boundary layers typical of off-ice winds in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) or even greater if the ice has been broken by a recent storm. CD values at the lower end of these ranges are associated with low inversion heights. These coefficients are confirmed by 103CD of 2.9, 2.5, and 3.1 for first-year sea ice calculated from gust probe data collected by the NOAA P-3 aircraft, interior to the inner MIZ in the Bering Sea during the Marginal Ice Zone Experiment (MIZEX-West) in February 1983, and 103CD of 2.6 for the Arctic calculated from Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment (AIDJEX) aircraft data for February 1976. The effective drag coefficient with the presence of even a small concentration of sea ice is greater than the oceanic value as shown by a 103CD of 2.2 calculated from NOAA P-3 gust probe data over a 40-km track of 0.4 ice concentration in the outer MIZ of the Greenland Sea in June 1984 during MIZEX-84. The relation of surface wind and stress to the geostrophic wind for shallow inversion heights, typical of high latitudes, is reviewed with a turbulent closure atmospheric boundary layer model. The winter Arctic is typified by low inversions ({\textless}100 m), low geostrophic drag coefficients, and large geostrophic/surface wind turning angles, with low functional dependence on surface roughness. Seasonal ice zones are typified by a more modest influence of the inversion on boundary layer characteristics.},

	abstract = {In reviewing the current status of our understanding of the mechanisms underlying wind-wave generation, it is apparent that existing theories and models are not applicable to situations where the sea surface is disturbed by breaking waves, and that the available experimental data on this question are sparse. In this context, this paper presents the results of a detailed study of the effects of wave breaking on the aerodynamic surface pressure distribution and consequent wave-coherent momentum flux, as well as its influence on the total wind stress. Two complementary experimental configurations were used to focus on the details and consequences of the pressure distribution over breaking waves under wind forcing. The first utilized a stationary breaking wave configuration and confirmed the presence of significant phase shifting, due to air flow separation effects, between the surface pressure and surface elevation (and slope) distributions over a range of wind speeds. The second configuration examined the pressure distribution, recorded at a fixed height above the mean water surface just above the crest level, over short mechanically triggered waves which were induced to break almost continuously under wind forcing. This allowed a very detailed comparison of the form drag for actively breaking waves and for waves of comparable steepness just prior to breaking (‘incipiently’ breaking waves). For these propagating steep-wave experiments, the pressure phase shifts and distributions closely paralleled the stationary configuration findings. Moreover, a large increase (typically 100\%) in the total windstress was observed for the breaking waves, with the increase corresponding closely to the comparably enhanced form drag associated with the actively breaking waves. In addition to further elucidating some fundamental features of wind-wave interactions for very steep wind waves, this paper provides a useful data set for future model calculations of wind flow over breaking waves. The results also provide the basis for a parameterization of the wind input source function applicable for a wave field undergoing active breaking, an important result for numerical modelling of short wind waves. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

The snowpack receives heat at daytime while releases heat every night. Snow thinning was due to approximately equal contributions of the increase of snow density, melt, and evaporation. The surface albedo only decreased from 0.9 to 0.8. During a case of cold air advection, the sensible heat flux was even below ?50 W m?2. At night, the snow surface temperature was strongly controlled by the incoming longwave radiation. The diurnal cycle in the downward solar radiation drove diurnal cycles in 14 other variables. Comparisons against observations from the Arctic sea ice in summer indicated that at ISPOL the air was colder, surface albedo was higher, and a larger portion of the absorbed solar radiation was returned to the atmosphere via turbulent heat fluxes. The limited melt allowed larger diurnal cycles.

High-frequency observations of velocity, temperature and water vapour have been used to calculate turbulent fluxes of momentum, heat and moisture using the eddy covariance method. These are the first direct air?sea flux observations in this region, and add to the relatively small collection of direct air?sea flux observations made in high wind speed conditions. The aircraft-based turbulence legs were flown at remarkably low levels, only 30?50 m above the sea-surface and so within the atmospheric surface layer. Results are presented for 145 flux runs, each of 2 min (approximately 12 km), 131 over open water and 14 over sea ice and the marginal ice zone. The flux data were obtained in 10 m neutral wind speeds of up to 25 m s?1, with 80\% of the flux data in the range 15?19 m s?1. Over open water, the wind stress varied from 0.2 to 1.9 N m?2 and the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes from 50 to 300 W m?2, resulting in total surface heat fluxes of up to 600 W m?2. The exchange coefficients are at the upper end of those previously observed. Mean values for the 15?19 m s?1 range are CDN = 2.04 ? 10?3, CHN = 1.63 ? 10?3 and CEN = 1.57 ? 10?3 for momentum, heat and moisture, respectively. The value of the momentum exchange coefficient is in line with previous studies; however, both the heat and moisture exchange coefficients are higher than in previous studies. Values of CDN over sea ice and the marginal ice zone were in the range 1.67?6.29 ? 10?3 and were, for these conditions, generally higher than CDN over adjacent open water areas. No significant spatial patterns in the exchange coefficients over open water have been detected, although there is some suggestion of higher exchange coefficients immediately downwind of the sea ice.

The transport is found to be sensitive to wind stress perturbations both along the ACC path and also in remote regions. The time scale of influence of wind stress perturbations is on the order of 100 days. Regarding spatial scales, the sensitivity of transport to wind stress is relatively smooth in regions of flat topography. In boundary regions and regions with complex topography, however, the sensitivity is enhanced and characterized by shorter length scales of order 100 km. Positive perturbations to the zonal wind stress usually increase the ACC transport, though the wind stress curl is of primary influence where the currents are steered by topography. Highlighting locations where the ACC is especially responsive to air?sea momentum fluxes reveals where an accurate determination of atmospheric winds may best enhance ocean modeling efforts.},

The momentum roughness length uses a sea state parameterization which is fully consistent with the surface turbulent flux parameterization. The flux parameterization accounts for the fetch limitation of the airflow over a lead. The surface roughness length for heat is determined from an application of surface renewal theory to the air-sea interface. The modeled fluxes are compared with in situ observations of lead fluxes. We also compare our model results with a bulk flux algorithm which has been commonly used to evaluate surface heat fluxes from leads. We perform sensitivity studies to examine the role of the surface renewal timescale, the importance of the cool skin, and impact of wave age dependence on the momentum roughness length. We have computed integral heat fluxes as a function of lead width/fetch for various atmospheric states to determine the magnitude of heat flux in a mesoscale model grid in which a lead is present.},

	abstract = {Inter-annual variations in Arctic sea ice drift speed (Vi) in 1989?2009 were analyzed on the basis of buoy data and atmospheric circulation indices. In the circumpolar and eastern Arctic and the Fram Strait, the annual mean Vi was best explained by the sea level pressure (SLP) difference across the Arctic Ocean along meridians 270°E and 90°E, called as the Central Arctic Index (CAI). In general, Vi was more strongly related to CAI than to the Dipole Anomaly (DA). This was because CAI is calculated across the Transpolar Drift Stream (TDS), whereas the pressure patterns affecting DA sometimes move far from TDS. CAI also has the benefit of being a simple index, insensitive to the calculation method applied, whereas DA, as the second mode of a principal component analysis, is sensitive both to the time period and area of calculations. In summer, the circulation index most important for the circumpolar mean Vi was the SLP gradient across the Fram Strait. In the Canadian Basin in winter, the Arctic Oscillation index was most important. Circulation indices explained 48\% of the variance of the annual mean Viin the circumpolar Arctic, 38\% in the eastern Arctic, and 25\% in the Canadian Basin. The local air-ice momentum flux (τ) was always better than the 10 m wind speed in explaining Vi, but τ outperformed the circulation indices only in the Fram Strait. Atmospheric forcing did not explain the increasing trend in Vi in the period 1989?2009.},

	abstract = {Polar regions have great sensitivity to climate forcing; however, understanding of the physical processes coupling the atmosphere and ocean in these regions is relatively poor. Improving our knowledge of high-latitude surface fluxes will require close collaboration among meteorologists, oceanographers, ice physicists, and climatologists, and between observationalists and modelers, as well as new combinations of in situ measurements and satellite remote sensing. This article describes the deficiencies in our current state of knowledge about air?sea surface fluxes in high latitudes, the sensitivity of various high-latitude processes to changes in surface fluxes, and the scientific requirements for surface fluxes at high latitudes. We inventory the reasons, both logistical and physical, why existing flux products do not meet these requirements. Capturing an annual cycle in fluxes requires that instruments function through long periods of cold polar darkness, often far from support services, in situations subject to icing and extreme wave conditions. Furthermore, frequent cloud cover at high latitudes restricts the availability of surface and atmospheric data from visible and infrared (IR) wavelength satellite sensors. Recommendations are made for improving high-latitude fluxes, including 1) acquiring more in situ observations, 2) developing improved satellite-flux-observing capabilities, 3) making observations and flux products more accessible, and 4) encouraging flux intercomparisons.},

	abstract = {Turbulent surface fluxes were studied using observations taken over sea ice in the Baltic Sea in March 1998. The fluxes of momentum and sensible heat were measured by a sonic anemometer and compared with fluxes derived from wind velocity and air-temperature profiles. The neutral 10 m drag coefficient showed no apparent dependence on wind speed (in the range 2–20 m s–1), resulting in a mean value of 1.0 × 10–3 for smooth snow-covered ice and 1.5 × 10−3 for deformed ice. The overall mean value was 1.28 × 10–3. The roughness length for temperature revealed a greater apparent dependence on wind speed and was slightly larger than the aerodynamic roughness for low wind speeds, and vice versa for moderate and high winds. We give an empirical expression that predicts how the scalar roughness depends on the aerodynamic roughness (drag coefficient) and wind speed. Agreement of the gradient-method results with the eddy-flux results supports the validity of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Fluxes modelled by a coupled air-ice-sea model compared well with the eddy-flux and gradient methods. Surface temperature estimates by the three methods also agreed well. Tests and sensitivity analysis emphasize the need for especially accurate sensor calibration and strict information about the sensor heights for the gradient method.},

No existing theory of wave-current interactions explains this behaviour, although it is symptomatic of Gerstner waves, rotational waves that are exact solutions to the Euler equations.

The UAS combines nadir and oblique imagery to create a wide field of view (FOV), which enables collection of mobile, long dwell timeseries of the littoral zone suitable for structure-from-motion (SfM), and wave speed inversion algorithms. Resultant digital surface models (DSMs) compare well with terrestrial topographic lidar and bathymetric survey data at Duck, NC, USA, with roor-mean-square error (RMSE)/bias of 0.26/-0.05 and 0.34/-0.05 m, respectively. Bathymetric data from another flight at Virginia Beach, VA, USA, demonstrates successful comparison (RMSE/bias of 0.17/0.06 m) in a secondary environment. UAS-derived engineering data products, total volume profiles and shoreline position, were congruent with those calculated from traditional topo-bathymetric surveys at Duck. Capturing both topography and bathymetry within a single flight, the presented multicamera system is more efficient than data acquisition with a single camera UAS; this advantage grows for longer stretches of coastline (10 km). Efficiency increases further with an on-board Global Navigation Satellite System-Inertial Navigation System (GNSS-INS) to eliminate ground control point (GCP) placement. The Appendix reprocesses the Virginia Beach flight with the GNSS-INS input and no GCPs. The resultant DSM products are comparable [root-mean-squared difference (RMSD)/bias of 0.62/-0.09 m, and processing time is significantly reduced.},

Fluid properties are not significantly altered by the fluorescent dye, which results in a non-intrusive measurement technique. The technique is validated by determining the free surface of a hydraulic flow over an obstacle and circular waves generated after droplet impact. Free surface waves can be accurately determined over a height of L= 100 mm in a large two-dimensional domain (y(x, z) = 120 × 62 mm2), with sufficient accuracy to determine small amplitude variations (η≈ 0.2 mm). The temporal resolution (Δt= 19 ms) is only limited by the available scanning equipment (f= 1 kHz rate). For other applications, this domain can be scaled as needed.

Rip current flows are partitioned into mean, infragravity, very low frequency (vorticity), and tidal contributions, and it is found that each contributes significantly to the total. Data from the laboratory and the field suggest that the rip current strength increases with increasing wave energy and decreasing water depths.

	abstract = {The description of wave climate at a local scale is of paramount importance for offshore and coastal engineering applications. Conditions influencing wave characteristics at a specific location cannot, however, be fully understood by studying only local information. It is necessary to take into account the dynamics of the ocean surface over a large 'upstream' wave generation area. The goal of this work is to provide a methodology to easily characterize the area of influence of any particular ocean location worldwide. Moreover, the developed method is able to characterize the wave energy and travel time in that area. The method is based on a global scale analysis using both geographically and physically based criteria. The geographic criteria rely on the assumption that deep water waves travel along great circle paths. This limits the area of influence by neglecting energy that cannot reach a target point, as its path is blocked by land. The individual spectral partitions from a global wave reanalysis are used to reconstruct the spectral information and apply the physically based criteria. The criteria are based on the selection of the fraction of energy that travels towards the target point for each analysed grid point. The method has been tested on several locations worldwide. Results provide maps that inform about the relative importance of different oceanic areas to the local wave climate at any target point. This information cannot be inferred from local parameters and agrees with information from other approaches. The methodology may be useful in a number of applications, such as statistical downscaling, storm tracking and grid definition in numerical modelling. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.08.019},
	abstract = {It is generally accepted that the fluid layer surrounding Earth should be considered as a single system at short and longer spatiotemporal scales. The current knowledge on the complex mechanisms of atmosphere-ocean interactions is still insufficient. This translates to the simulation of atmosphere and ocean as a single fully coupled system constructing multi-scale, multi-model integrated modeling systems. In this study, a new two-way coupled atmosphere-ocean wave modeling system is introduced with overarching aim to thoroughly unveil the impact of waves on the sea surface roughness and the atmospheric properties. The newly developed system consists of the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and Hydrology (WRF-Hydro) as the atmospheric component and the Wave model (WAM) as the ocean wave component. WRF and WAM models are coupled using the OASIS Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT) that enables models to communicate and exchange the information required to refine their simulation results. CHAOS (Chemical Hydrological Atmospheric Ocean wave System) has been tested in a high-impact cyclonic system over the Mediterranean Sea employing one-way and two-way coupling simulations to assess the air-sea interactions, currently neglecting the chemical and hydrological capabilities. The encapsulation of the ocean waves in the atmospheric surface layer processes modifies the characteristics of atmospheric flow and determines the ocean wave generation. A remarkable finding is that the coupling of the two systems affects the air-sea momentum, enthalpy and moisture transfer determining the evolution of the cyclonic system. The interactions along the air-sea interface are also reflected in the vertical structure of troposphere and its properties. CHAOS in two-way coupling mode shows an overall improvement of the forecast skill up to 20\% over the sea while positively affects the atmospheric predictability over the land.},

Although convective mixing homogenized the water column to 40 m depth almost every night, the combination of diurnal warming on clear days and rainfall on cloudy days routinely produced strong stratification in the upper 10 m. Whether due to thermal or freshwater effects, the initial strong stratification was mixed downward and incorporated in the bulk of the mixed layer within a few hours. Stratification cycling was associated with pronounced variability of ocean surface boundary layer turbulence and vertical shear of wind-driven (Ekman) currents. Decoupled from the bulk of the mixed layer by strong stratification, warm and fresh near-surface waters were rapidly accelerated by wind, producing the well-known “slippery layer” effect, and leading to a strong downwind near-surface distortion of the Ekman profile. A case study illustrates the ability of the new generation of Lagrangian floats to measure rapidly evolving temperature, salinity, and velocity, including turbulent and internal wave components.

Contributing to the second phase of the Salinity Processes in the Upper-ocean Regional Study (SPURS-2) carried out in the precipitation-dominated Intertropical Convergence Zone of the eastern Pacific, we deployed six Lagrangian drifters equipped with two pairs of temperature and conductivity sensors at 0.4 m and 5 m depth. Over the first three months, the drifter measurements revealed that (1) the wind strongly affects surface freshening resulting from rainfall and diurnal warming so that near-surface salinity and temperature gradients generally do not form at wind speeds greater than 7 m s−1, (2) temperature and salinity differences between the two measurement depths are positively correlated for the cases of surface warming/salinification and freshening/cooling, (3) the lifetimes of rain-induced salinity anomalies can reach 24 hours, longer than previous estimates, (4) temperature (at 0.4 m and 5 m depth) and salinity (at 0.4 m depth) exhibit diurnal cycles, modulated by the wind, and (5) the differences that have been observed between satellite SSS and the standard uppermost salinity from Argo measurements are unlikely to be related to the difference in measurement depths (surface skin layer vs ∼5 m depth).},

Alongside a weakening monsoon circulation, the locally available moisture and the frequency of moisture-laden depressions from the Bay of Bengal have also declined. Here we show that despite these negative trends, there is a threefold increase in widespread extreme rain events over central India during 1950-2015. The rise in these events is due to an increasing variability of the low-level monsoon westerlies over the Arabian Sea, driving surges of moisture supply, leading to extreme rainfall episodes across the entire central subcontinent. The homogeneity of these severe weather events and their association with the ocean temperatures underscores the potential predictability of these events by two-to-three weeks, which offers hope in mitigating their catastrophic impact on life, agriculture and property.},

	abstract = {This research presents a case study that examines an upper-ocean salinity response to intense rainfall using 4 years of observed salinity data from the Aquarius and Argo floats. The Aquarius sea surface salinity (SSS) in the subtropical region of the North Pacific reveals a notable event in which SSS is locally freshened by intense rainfall. Although the SSS pattern shortly after the rainfall reflects the atmospheric pattern, its final form reflects the ocean’s dynamic structure; low-salinity water distributes in the shape of an anticyclonic eddy. Observations using Argo profiling floats confirm that low-salinity water dominates the entire water column of the eddy above 70 m. We found that an eddy stirring effect would play an important role in forming the eddy-shaped low-salinity water. As a precondition, intense rainfall on the tropical side enhances the meridional gradient of background SSS with freshened low-salinity water to the south and saline water to the north. The anticyclonic eddy located at the enhanced SSS front stirs the water in a clockwise direction. Specifically, northward flow in the western side of the eddy transports fresh water, whereas southward flow in the eastern side transports saline water. As this northward–southward flow moves the eddy to the west where the transported fresh water is dominant as a baroclinic Rossby wave, this dynamic process would form the eddy-shaped low-salinity water. This clear view of such eddy stirring is due to the inherent nature of the subtropical region that is characterized by less frequent precipitation.},

	abstract = {The intensity of tropical cyclones is sensitive to the rates at which enthalpy and momentum are transferred between sea and air in the high-wind core of the storm. Present models of the wind dependence of these transfer rates suggest that the effective drag coefficient is more than twice the effective enthalpy transfer coefficient at wind speeds above 25 m s(-1). Using this ratio in numerical models, however, makes it impossible to sustain storms of greater than marginal hurricane intensity. Some other physical process must, therefore, enhance enthalpy transfer at very high wind speeds. This paper suggests that re-entrant sea spray explains this enhanced transfer. When a spray droplet is ejected from the ocean, it remains airborne long enough to cool to a temperature below the local air temperature but not long enough to evaporate an appreciable fraction of its mass. The spray droplet thus gives up sensible heat and returns to the sea before it has time to extract back from the atmosphere the heat necessary to continue its evaporation. Microphysical modeling, combined with data from the Humidity Exchange over the Sea Experiment (HEXOS), makes it possible to derive an expression for the net enthalpy transfer of re-entrant spray. This spray enthalpy flux is roughly cubic in wind speed. When this relation is used in a numerical simulation of a hurricane, the spray more than compensates for the observed increase in the ratio of drag and enthalpy transfer coefficients with wind speed. The momentum flux associated with sea spray is an important energy sink that moderates the effects of this spray enthalpy flux. Including a parameterization for this momentum sink along with wave drag and spray enthalpy transfer in the hurricane simulation produces results that are similar to ones based on equal transfer coefficients.},

Significant density stratification at depths ≤ 5 m was observed in 38\% of a 2-month data set from the central Indian Ocean collected during the DYNAMO experiment (Dynamics of the MJO, Madden-Julian Oscillation). Diurnal warm layers (DWLs) formed by solar heating populated 30\% of the data set and rain layers (RLs) populated 16\%. Combined contributions from rain and insolation formed RL-DWLs in 9\% of the data set. RLs were detected at values of U 10 up to 9.8 m s −1 , while DWLs were only detected at U 10  {\textless} 7.6 m s −1 (99th percentile values), symptomatic of the greater buoyancy flux provided by moderate to high rain rate compared to insolation. From the ocean friction velocity, u *w , and surface buoyancy flux, B, we derived estimates of (Formula presented.), stable layer depth, and (Formula presented.), the maximum U 10 for which stratification should persist at (Formula presented.) for fixed B. These estimates predicted (1) 36 out of 44 observed stratification events (88\% success rate) and (2) the wind limits of these events, which are considered to be the 99th percentile values of U 10 ). This suggests a means to determine the presence of ocean stable layers at depths ≤ 5 m from U 10 and B. Near-surface stratification varied throughout two Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) cycles. In suppressed MJO periods, (U 10  ≤ 8 m s −1 with strong insolation), RLs and RL-DWLs were rare while DWLs occurred daily. During disturbed and active MJO periods, (U 10  ≤ 8 m s −1 with increased rain and cloudiness), multiple RLs and RL-DWLs formed per day and DWLs became less common. When westerly wind bursts occurred, (U 10  = 7–17 m s −1 with steady rain), RLs formed infrequently and DWLs were not detected.},

	abstract = {The broad, shallow body of warm ({\textgreater}29°C) water found in the western tropical Pacific Ocean plays an important role in the coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics and thermodynamics associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. Thus, it is important to understand the processes that maintain and perturb that warm pool. Measurements from a buoy moored in the center of the warm pool during the TOGA Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment show that the exchange of mass between the ocean and atmosphere is as important as the exchange of heat. Rain forms a shallow, buoyant layer that does not mix with the water below except during infrequent strong wind events. Using a one-dimensional mixed layer model, it is demonstrated that the rate of local precipitation governs the mixed layer depth and can thus alter the rates of change in sea surface temperature during both warming and cooling periods. The observed mixed layer depth in the warm pool is at a depth that allows for maximum warming by capturing a significant portion of the shortwave radiation, but is shallow enough to avoid entrainment cooling. Either increased rain rates or reduced wind forcing yields a shallow mixed layer, which may be associated with cooling of the sea surface temperature in spite of a net positive heat flux at the sea surface because penetrating shortwave radiation is lost across the base of the shallow, fresh mixed layer. Decreased rain rates or increased wind forcing can turn on entrainment cooling of the surface mixed layer.},

Accurate prediction of pollutant pathways and concentrations at the ocean surface requires understanding ocean dynamics over a broad range of spatial scales. Fundamental questions concerning the structure of the velocity field at the submesoscales (100 m to tens of kilometers, hours to days) remain unresolved due to a lack of synoptic measurements at these scales. Using high-frequency position data provided by the near-simultaneous release of hundreds of accurately tracked surface drifters, we study the structure of submesoscale surface velocity fluctuations in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Observed two-point statistics confirm the accuracy of classic turbulence scaling laws at 200-m to 50-km scales and clearly indicate that dispersion at the submesoscales is local, driven predominantly by energetic submesoscale fluctuations. The results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of deploying large clusters of drifting instruments to provide synoptic observations of spatial variability of the ocean surface velocity field. Our findings allow quantification of the submesoscale-driven dispersion missing in current operational circulation models and satellite altimeter-derived velocity fields.},

	abstract = {In a recent paper by Geernaert (1988) it was suggested that the stress and wind vectors are rarely aligned and that the deviation of the stress vector direction from the wind vector is related to the surface heat flux. It was argued that since cold air advection over the open ocean generally corresponds to upward heat flux, the consequent rotation of the winds to the right with height during cold air advection could be responsible for observations of the stress vector to be to the right of the wind flow for unstable stratifications. Conversely, observations of the stress vector to the left of the flow for stable stratifications were suggested to be associated with the turning of the wind vector to the left of the flow for warm air advection, or downward heat flux. In that study only 30\% of the statistical variance of the angle between the wind and wind stress vectors could be explained by air-sea heat flux, and it was suggested that the orbital velocity spectrum of surface waves (i.e., data unavailable in that study) could be important for explaining at least part of the remaining variance. In this study we report on measurements of the wind stress vector and wave directional spectrum collected during the Synthetic Aperture Radar X-Band Ocean Nonlinearities experiment. Conducted on the Chesapeake Light Tower during 1988, the experiment yielded data reported herein that provide convincing evidence that the stress vector direction, during light winds and near-zero air-sea heat flux, is governed in large part by the direction of long waves on the ocean surface. Further, the measurements suggest that the stress vector has a direction which is a blend between the wind direction and the swell direction.},

The imaging slope gauge method is used, which is based on the shape from refraction principle. The downward looking camera with a telecentric lens observes the refraction of light rays coming from a high power custom telecentric LED light source that is placed underneath the wind wave facility. The light source can be programmed to arbitrary intensity gradients in the x- and y-direction, so that the origin of a light ray is coded in intensity. Four gradient images (acquired at 6000 fps) are combined for one 2D slope image. By only using intensity ratios, the measurements become independent of lens effects from the curved water surface and inhomogeneities in the light source. Independence of wave height is guaranteed by using telecentric illumination and telecentric imaging. The system is capable to measure the slopes of a wind-driven water surface in the Heidelberg Aeolotron wind-wave facility on a footprint of 200 x 160 mm with a spatial resolution of 0.22 mm and a temporal resolution of more than 1500 fps. For the first time, it is now possible to investigate the structure of short wind-induced waves with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to study their dynamic characteristics without aliasing effects.

The wave evolution is well predicted by a numerical model based on the one-dimensional nonlinear shallow water equations with bore dissipation. The model is initialized with the time series of sea surface elevation and cross-shore current observed at the most offshore sensors (located about 50 to 120 m from the mean shoreline in mean water depths 0.80 to 2.10 m). The model accurately predicts the cross-shore variation of energy at both infragravity (nominally 0.004 {\textless} f \_{\textless} 0.05 Hz) and sea swell (here 0.05 {\textless} f \_{\textless} 0.18 Hz) frequencies. In models of surf zone hydrodynamics, wave energy dissipation is frequently parameterized in terms of \%, the ratio of the sea swell significant wave height to the local mean water depth. The observed and predicted values of-• increase with increasing beach slope fi and decreasing normalized (by a characteristic wavenumber k) water depth kh and are well correlated with [3/kh, a measure of the fractional change in water depth over a wavelength.

	abstract = {Radar observations of the sea surface at C-Band and small incidence angles are used to investigate some properties of the surface slope probability density function (pdf). The method is based on the analysis of the variation of the radar cross-section with incidence angle, assuming a backscattering process following the Geometrical Optics theory. First, we assess the limit of this model in our experimental configuration by using simulations of radar cross-sections with a more accurate backscattering model, namely the Physical Optics model. We show that roughness properties with scales larger than 12 cm can be analyzed in our configuration (C-Band, incidence 7 to 16°). The radar data are then analyzed in terms of filtered mean square slope under the assumption of a Gaussian slope pdf. Dependence of the radar-derived mean square slopes (mss) with wind speed is analyzed, thanks to wind estimates obtained by using coincident observations of the same radar at larger incidence (around 32°). Furthermore an analysis of the anisotropy of the mean square slope is proposed. The results are discussed in comparison with those of Cox and Munk (1954a, 1954b), and with the mean square slopes derived from two surface models (Elfouhaily et al., 1997 and Kudryavtsev et al., 2003). We find that the radar-derived values are in good agreement with Cox and Munk results, taking into account the filtering effect on radar-derived values. We also show that the surface model of Elfouhaily et al. yields good agreement for the omni directional mss, but a too large anisotropy of the mss. The model of Kudryavtsev provides a reasonable anisotropy of the mss, but overestimates the mss values in all directions. Finally, we propose an analysis of the radar data under a non-Gaussian assumption for the slope pdf, by applying the compound model suggested by Chapron et al. (2000) to our observations. To our knowledge, it is the first time that peakedness values are explicitly derived from radar observations, and documented as a function of azimuth and wind speed. We show that the peakedness (or kurtosis) of the slope pdf is not zero but weak (peakedness factor reaching about 0.20), and slightly increases with wind speed.},

	abstract = {A field experiment is used to evaluate a numerical model of the sheltering of gravity waves by islands offshore of the Southern California region. The sheltering model considered here includes only the effects of island blocking and wave refraction over the island bathymetry. Wave frequency and directional spectra measured in the deep ocean (unsheltered region west of the islands) were used as input to the sheltering model and compared with coastal observations. An airborne L-band synthetic aperture radar was used to image the directional properties of the waves in the deep ocean. In addition to the unsmoothed spectra, a unimodal directional spectrum model obtained from fits to the radar spectra was also employed to suppress the high noise level of this system. Coastal measurements were made in about 10 m depth at Torrey Pines Beach with a high resolution array of pressure sensors. The model predictions and data at Torrey Pines Beach agree well in a limited frequency range (0.082 to 0.114 Hz) where the unimodal deep ocean model is appropriate. The prediction that unimodal northern swell in the deep ocean results in a bimodal directional spectrum at Torrey Pines Beach is quantitatively verified. The northern peak of the bimodal spectra is due to waves coming through the window between San Clemente and San Miguel-Santa Rosa Islands. The southerly peak is due to wave refraction over Cortez and Tanner Banks. For lower frequency waves, the effects of strong refraction in the island vicinity are shown qualitatively. Refraction can theoretically supply up to approximately 10\% of the deep ocean energy that is otherwise blocked at this site. The modifications of the island shadows due to wave refraction become theoretically negligible for wave frequencies {\textgreater}0.11 Hz. Also, local wave generation effects, which are not included in this sheltering model, are shown to be occasionally important for waves with frequencies {\textgreater}0.12 Hz. ?? 1984.},

In this paper, the focus is on the study of the stress vector direction relative to the mean wind and surface-wave directions. Results based on measurements made during three field campaigns onboard the R/P Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP) in the Pacific are discussed. In general, the wind stress is a vector sum of the 1) pure shear stress (turbulent and viscous) aligned with the mean wind shear, 2) wind-wave-induced stress aligned with the direction of the pure wind-sea waves, and 3) swell-induced stress aligned with the swell direction. The direction of the wind-wave-induced stress and the swell-induced stress components may coincide with, or be opposite to, the direction of wave propagation (pure wind waves and swell, respectively). As a result, the stress vector may deviate widely from the mean wind flow, including cases in which stress is directed across or even opposite to the wind.},

The effect of the wave field on the mean flow is described by an interaction stress tensor and a surface mass transfer. The results are applied to Phillips’ and Longuet-Higgins’ model of short waves breaking on the crests of long carrier waves. It is found that the work done on the long waves by the interaction stresses (corresponding to Longuet-Higgins’ ‘maser’ mechanism of wave generation) is almost exactly balanced by the loss of potential energy arising from the mass transfer. The residual energy transfer leads to attenuation of the long waves, independent of their propagation direction relative to the short waves. Damping factors are estimated from the upwind–downwind ratios of radar backscatter cross-sections. It is found that interactions with waves shorter than 35cm yield attenuation rates about an order of magnitude smaller than the observed growth rates due to the wind. © 1971, Cambridge University Press.

The number of iterations to solve for stability has been shortened from 20 to 3, and adjustments have been made to the basic profile stability functions. The scalar transfer coefficients have been redefined in terms of the mixing ratio, which is the fundamentally conserved quantity, rather than the measured water vapor mass concentration. Both the velocity and scalar roughness lengths have been changed. For the velocity roughness, the original fixed value of the Charnock parameter has been replaced by one that increases with wind speeds of between 10 and 18 m s−1.

One event with offshore winds of 9–11 m s-1 directed 20° from shore normal was observed with eight directional stations recording simultaneously and spanning a fetch from 4 to 83 km. An opposing swell of 1-m height and 10-s period was also present. The wind-sea part of the wave spectrum conforms to established growth curves for significant wave height and peak period, except at inner-shelf stations where a large alongshore wind-sea component was observed. At these short fetches, the mean wave direction ?m was observed to change abruptly across the wind-sea spectral peak, from alongshore at lower frequencies to downwind at higher frequencies. Waves from another event with offshore winds of 6–14 m s-1 directed 20°–30° from shore normal were observed with two instrument arrays. A significant amount of low-frequency wave energy was observed to propagate alongshore from the region where the wind was strongest. These measurements are used to assess the performance of some widely used parameterizations in wave models. The modeled transition of ?m across the wind-sea spectrum is smoother than that in the observations and is reproduced very differently by different parameterizations, giving insights into the appropriate level of dissipation. Calculations with the full Boltzmann integral of quartet wave–wave interactions reveal that the discrete interaction approximation parameterization for these interactions is reasonably accurate at the peak of the wind sea but overpredicts the directional spread at high frequencies. This error is well compensated by parameterizations of the wind input source term that have a narrow directional distribution. Observations also highlight deficiencies in some parameterizations of wave dissipation processes in mixed swell–wind-sea conditions.},

	abstract = {We present results from experiments designed to measure near-surface turbulence generated by rainfall. Laboratory experiments were performed using artificial rain falling at near-terminal velocity in a wind–wave channel filled with synthetic seawater. In this first series of experiments, no wind was generated and the receiving seawater was initially at rest. Rainfall rates from 40 to \$190{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{mm\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{h\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ were investigated. Subsurface turbulent velocities of the order of \$O(10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}){\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ are generated near the interface below the depth of the cavities generated by the rain drop impacts. The turbulence appears independent of rainfall rates. At depth larger than the size of the cavities, the turbulent velocity fluctuations decay as \$z{\textasciicircum}\{-3/2\}\$ . Turbulent length scales also appear to scale with the size of the impact cavities. In these seawater experiments, a freshwater lens is established at the water surface due to the rain. At the highest rain rate studied, the resulting buoyancy flux appears to lead to a shallower subsurface mixed layer and a slight decrease of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation. Finally, direct measurements and inertial estimates of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation show that approximately 0.1–0.3 \% of the kinetic energy flux from the rain is dissipated in the form of turbulence. This is consistent with existing freshwater measurements and suggests that high levels of dissipation occur at depths and scales smaller than those resolved here and/or that other phenomena dissipate a considerable amount of the total kinetic energy flux provided by rainfall.},

The model was parameterized with physical (waves and currents) and bacterial (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus) observations made during HB06. The model captured surfzone FIB dynamics well (average surfzone model skill: 0.84 \{. E. coli\} and 0.52 \{. Enterococcus\}), but fell short of capturing offshore FIB dynamics. Our analyses support the hypothesis that surfzone FIB variability during HB06 was a consequence of southward advection and diffusion of a patch of FIB originating north of the study area. Offshore FIB may have originated from a different, southern, source. Mortality may account for some of the offshore variability not explained by the physical model. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Moreover, the quasi-coherent theory has never been tested against field data, and it is not clear how the coherent information inherent to such models can be used for better understanding coastal wave and circulation dynamics. This study therefore revisits the derivation of quasi-coherent theory to formulate it into a radiative transport equation with a forcing term that accounts for the inhomogeneous part of the wave field.

These complications are normally important with offshore flow. The transfer coefficient for heat is computed from eddy correlation data taken at a mast two kilometres off the Danish coast in RASEX. For these coastal zone data, the thermal roughness length shows no well-defined relation to the momentum roughness length or roughness Reynolds number, in contrast to previous theories. The variation of the momentum roughness length is dominated by wave state. In contrast, the thermal roughness length shows significant dependence on wave state only for small values of wave age where the mixing is apparently enhanced by wave breaking. The development of thin internal boundary layers with offshore flow substantially reduces the heat transfer and thermal roughness length but has no obvious influence on momentum roughness length. A new formulation of the thermal roughness length based on the internal boundary-layer depth is calibrated to the RASEX data. For the very stable case, the turbulence is mainly detached from the surface and existing formulations do not apply. As an alternative to adjusting the thermal roughness length, the transfer coefficient is related directly to the stability and the internal boundary-layer depth. This avoids specification of roughness lengths resulting from the usual integration of the non-dimensional temperature function. The resulting stability function is simpler than previous ones and satisfies free convection similarity theory without introduction of the gustiness factor. The internal boundary layer also influences the moisture transfer coefficient.},

	volume = {A(8)},
	doi = {citeulike-article-id:2710264},
	abstract = {Wave spectra were measured along a profile extending 160 kilometers into the North Sea westward from Sylt for a period often weeks in 1968 and 1969. During the main experiment in July 1969, thirteen wave stations were in operation, of which six stations continued measurements into the first two weeks of August. A smaller pilot experiment was carried out in September 1968. Currents, tides, air-sea temperature differences and turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer were also measured. The goal of the experiment (described in Part 1) was to determine the structure of the source function governing the energy balance of the wave spectrum, with particular emphasis on wave growth under stationary offshore wind conditions (Part 2) and the attenuation of swell in water of finite depth (Part 3). The source functions of wave spectra generated by offshore winds exhibit a characteristic plus-minus signature associated with the shift of the sharp spectral peak towards lower frequencies. The two-lobed distribution of the source function can be explained quantitatively by the nonlinear transfer due to resonant wave-wave interactions (second order Bragg scattering). The evolution of a pronounced peak and its shift towards lower frequencies can also be understood as a selfstabilizing feature of this process. For small fetches, the principal energy balance is between the input by wind in the central region of the spectrum and the nonlinear transfer of energy away from this region to short waves, where it is dissipated, and to longer waves. Most of the wave growth on the forward face of the spectrum can be attributed to the nonlinear transfer to longer waves. For short fetches, approximately (80 ± 20) \% of the momentum transferred across the air/sea interface enters the wave field, in agreement with Dobson's direct measurements of the work done on the waves by surface pressures. About 80-90 \% of the wave-induced momentum flux passes into currents via the nonlinear transfer to short waves and subsequent dissipation; the rest remains in the wave field and is advected away. At larger fetches the interpretation of the energy balance becomes more ambiguous on account of the unknown dissipation in the low-frequency part of the spectrum. Zero dissipation in this frequency range yields a minimal atmospheric momentum flux into the wave field of the order of (10 to 40) \% of the total momentum transfer across the air-sea interface -- but ratios up to 100 \% are conceivable if dissipation is important. In general, the ratios (as inferred from the nonlinear energy transfer) lie within these limits over a wide (five-decade) range of fetches encompassing both wave-tank and the present field data, suggesting that the scales of the spectrum continually adjust such that the wave-wave interactions just balance the energy input from the wind. This may explain, among other features, the observed decrease of Phillips' "constant" with fetch. The decay rates determined for incoming swell varied considerably, but energy attenuation factors of two along the length of the profile were typical. This is in order of magnitude agreement with expected damping rates due to bottom friction. However, the strong tidal modulation predicted by theory for the case of a quadratic bottom friction law was not observed. Adverse winds did not affect the decay rate. Computations also rule out wave-wave interactions or dissipation due to turbulence outside the bottom boundary layer as effective mechanisms of swell attenuation. We conclude that either the generally accepted friction law needs to be significantly modified or that some other mechanism, such as scattering by bottom irregularities, is the cause of the attenuation. The dispersion characteristics of the swells indicated rather nearby origins, for which the classical (i event model was generally inapplicable. A strong Doppler modulation by tidal currents was also observed.},

	abstract = {From experimental studies in digital processing of seismic reflection data, geophysicists know that a seismic signal does vary in amplitude, shape, frequency and phase, versus propagation time. To enhance the resolution of the seismic reflection method, we must investigate these variations in more detail.We present quantitative results of theoretical studies on propagation of plane waves for normal incidence, through perfectly elastic multilayered media.As wavelet shapes, we use zero-phase cosine wavelets modulated by a Gaussian envelope and the corresponding complex wavelets. A finite set of such wavelets, for an appropriate sampling of the frequency domain, may be taken as the basic wavelets for a Gabor expansion of any signal or trace in a two-dimensional (2-D) domain (time and frequency). We can then compute the wave propagation using complex functions and thereby obtain quantitative results including energy and phase of the propagating signals. These results appear as complex 2-D functions of time and frequency, i.e., as 'instantaneous frequency spectra.'Choosing a constant sampling rate on the logarithmic scale in the frequency domain leads to an appropriate sampling method for phase preservation of the complex signals or traces. For this purpose, we developed a Gabor expansion involving basic wavelets with a constant time duration/mean period ratio.For layered media, as found in sedimentary basins, we can distinguish two main types of series: (1) progressive series, and (2) cyclic or quasi-cyclic series. The second type is of high interest in hydrocarbon exploration.Progressive series do not involve noticeable distortions of the seismic signal. We studied, therefore, the wave propagation in cyclic series and, first, simple models made up of two components (binary media). Such periodic structures have a spatial period. We present synthetic traces computed in the time domain using the Goupillaud-Kunetz model of propagation for one-dimensional (1-D) synthetic seismograms.Three different cases appear for signal scattering, depending upon the value of the ratio wavelength of the signal/spatial period of the medium.(1) Large wavelengthsThe composite medium is fully transparent, but phase delaying. It acts like an homogeneous medium, with an 'effective velocity' and an 'effective impedance.'(2) Short wavelengthsFor wavelengths close to twice the spatial period of the medium, the composite medium strongly attenuates the transmission, and superreflectivity occurs as counterpart.(3) Intermediate wavelengthsFor intermediate values of the frequency, velocity dispersion versus frequency appears.All these phenomena are studied in the frequency domain, by analytic formulation of the transfer functions of the composite media for transmission and reflection. Such phenomena are similar to Bloch waves in crystal lattices as studied in solid state physics, with only a difference in scale, and we checked their conformity with laboratory measurements.Such models give us an easy way to introduce the use of effective velocities and impedances which are frequency dependent, i.e., complex. They will be helpful for further developments of 'complex deconvolution.'The above results can be extended to quasi-cyclic media made up of a random distribution of double layers. For signal transmission, quasi-cyclic series act as a high cut filter with possible time delay, velocity dispersion, and 'constant Q' type of law for attenuation. For signal reflection they act as a low cut filter, with possible superreflections.These studies could be extended to three-dimensional (3-D) binary models (grains and pores in a porous reservoir), in agreement with well-known acoustic properties of gas reservoirs (theory of bright spots).We present some applications to real well data. Velocity dispersion may explain: mistying between sonic logs and velocity surveys; mistying between synthetic seismograms and seismic sections.Effective velocities lower than mean velocities may explain: very low velocities for P- and S-waves, especially in weathered shallow layers; anomalies on the values of the ratio V s /V p ; mistying between P and S seismic sections.Finally, the Gabor expansion provides a tool to obtain sampled instantaneous frequency spectra, and to carry out a suitable recording and processing method in high-resolution seismic, especially to preserve the phase information. Such a processing will involve complex signals, complex traces, complex velocities and complex impedances.For practical purpose, this paper comprises two separate parts. Here, we present some interesting features on the scattering of seismic signals obtained by a simulation method using simple models. We show the usefulness of the notions of complex signals, complex velocities, and complex impedances, and overall of the Gabor expansion, by simulation on very simple models.Morlet et al, (1982, this issue) will be concerned with the development of fundamental notions useful to handle seismic data from the sampling method of recording to processing methods. There we give theoretical and practical tools to sample and handle these data in the time-frequency domain, using complex functions.},

The idea of a coupled atmosphere-waves-ocean model was proposed by Klaus Hasselmann Hasselmann, 1991, in the context of climate modeling. As waves are the ``gearbox'' between the atmosphere and the ocean, a detailed understanding of waves can significantly improve the parameterization of air-sea fluxes and surface processes. Besides, Earth observation systems rely extensively on satellite remote sensing techniques for surface winds, temperature, sea level, ocean color, and sea ice, all affected by surface waves. Hasselmann viewed the future of wave modeling as the development of this central gearbox of a general Earth observation and monitoring system, providing fluxes between ocean and atmosphere in a way consistent with satellite observations. This vision, though slow to materialize, is highly relevant for short-term forecasting in the coastal ocean.},

	abstract = {[1] Asymptotic models ( small perturbation and small slope approximation at first-order, Kirchhoff approximation or two-scale model) used to predict the normalized radar cross section of the sea surface generally fail to reproduce in detail backscatter radar measurements. In particular, the predicted polarization ratio versus incidence and azimuth angles is not in agreement with experimental data. This denotes the inability of these standard models to fully take into account the roughness properties with respect to the sensor's configuration of measurement ( frequency, incidence, and polarization). On the basis of particular assumptions, to decompose the scattered electromagnetic field between zones covered with freely propagating waves and others where roughness and slopes are enhanced, recent works were able to match observations. In this paper, we do not assume such a decomposition but study the latest improvements obtained in the field of approximate scattering theories of random rough surfaces using the local and resonant curvature approximations. These models are based on an extension of the Kirchhoff Approximation up to first order to relate explicitly the curvature properties of the sea surface to the polarization strength of the scattered electromagnetic field. Consistency with previous approaches is discussed. As shown, dynamically taking into account the sea surface curvature properties of the surface is crucial to better interpret normalized radar cross-section and polarization ratio sensitivities to both sensor characteristics and geophysical environment conditions. The proposed developments, termed the Resonant Curvature Approximation (RCA), are found to reproduce experimental data versus incidence angle and azimuth direction. The polarization sensitivity to the wind direction and incidence angle is largely improved. Finally, Gaussian statistical assumption adopted to derive the analytical expression of the normalized radar cross section is also discussed. In particular, the third-order cumulant function is shown to better reproduce the second-order up-/down-wind azimuth modulation. The proposed developments appear very promising for improvement of our understanding and analysis of both sea surface radar backscatter and Doppler signals.},

One likely candidate for much of the scatter is the underlying wave field. Unfortunately, few campaigns over the years have included spectral measurements of the waves. Among those that have, the results are inconclusive. Here data are presented from the Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment and High Resolution Remote Sensing Program campaigns in which 3-m discus buoys were instrumented with K-Gill and sonic anemometers and complete motion packages to measure the direct (eddy correlation) stress and, concurrently, the directional ocean wave spectrum. These data are examined for the effects of swell on the drag coefficient.

	abstract = {The Grand LAgrangian Deployment (GLAD) used multiscale sampling and GPS technology to observe time series of drifter positions with initial drifter separation of O(100 m) to O(10 km), and nominal 5 min sampling, during the summer and fall of 2012 in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Histograms of the velocity field and its statistical parameters are non-Gaussian; most are multimodal. The dominant periods for the surface velocity field are 1–2 days due to inertial oscillations, tides, and the sea breeze; 5–6 days due to wind forcing and submesoscale eddies; 9–10 days and two weeks or longer periods due to wind forcing and mesoscale variability, including the period of eddy rotation. The temporal e-folding scales of a fitted drifter velocity autocorrelation function are bimodal with time scales, 0.25–0.50 days and 0.9–1.4 days, and are the same order as the temporal e-folding scales of observed winds from nearby moored National Data Buoy Center stations. The Lagrangian integral time scales increase from coastal values of 8 h to offshore values of approximately 2 days with peak values of 3–4 days. The velocity variance is large, O(1)m2/s2, the surface velocity statistics are more anisotropic, and increased dispersion is observed at flow bifurcations. Horizontal diffusivity estimates are O(103)m2/s in coastal regions with weaker flow to O(105)m2/s in flow bifurcations, a strong jet, and during the passage of Hurricane Isaac. The Gulf of Mexico surface velocity statistics sampled by the GLAD drifters are a strong function of the feature sampled, topography, and wind forcing. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

The analysis shows that most techniques for the imaging of short wind waves, such as Stilwell photography and various stereo techniques, have significant deficiencies. Stereophotography is plagued by insufficient height resolution for small waves and by the problem that, because of the specular nature of reflection at the water surface, features seen in one image are not necessarily found in the other (correspondence problem).

Their reasoning is that within a well mixed layer the plankton organisms are about evenly distributed, but a net production takes place only above the compensation depth, whereas below the compensation depth there is a net loss of organic matter. The total population cannot increase if this loss exceeds the net production.},

We have measured bubble size distributions inside breaking waves in the laboratory and in the open ocean, and provide a quantitative description of bubble formation mechanisms in the laboratory. We find two distinct mechanisms controlling the size distribution, depending on bubble size. For bubbles larger than about 1 mm, turbulent fragmentation determines bubble size distribution, resulting in a bubble density proportional to the bubble radius to the power of -10/3. Smaller bubbles are created by jet and drop impact on the wave face, with a -3/2 power-law scaling. The length scale separating these processes is the scale where turbulent fragmentation ceases, also known as the Hinze scale. Our results will have important implications for the study of air-sea gas transfer.},

	abstract = {Temporal and spatial development of short gravity waves in a linear wind-wave tank has been measured for wind speeds up to 15 m/s using microwave Doppler spectrometry. Surface waves of wavelength 4·1 cm, 9·8 cm, 16·5 cm and 36 cm were observed as a function of fetch, wind speed and wind duration. The waves grew exponentially from inception until they were about 10 dB smaller than their maximum height, and the temporal growth and spectral transport (spatial growth) rates were about equal when the wave amplitude was sufficiently small. The amplitude of a short gravity wave of fixed wavelength was found to decrease substantially at winds, fetches or durations greater than those at which the short gravity wave was approximately the dominant wave; such phenomena are sometimes referred to as overshoot. The dominant short gravity wave was observed to reach a maximum amplitude which depended only on wavelength, showing that wave breaking induced by an augmented wind drift cannot be the primary limitation to the wave height. Waves travelling against the wind were observed for wavelengths of 9·8 cm, 16·5 cm and 36 cm and were shown to be generated by the air flow at low wind speeds. Measured initial growth rates for 16·5 cm and 36 cm waves were greater than expected, suggesting the existence of a growth mechanism in addition to direct transfer from the wind via linear instability of the boundary-layer flow. Initial temporal growth rates and spectral transport rates were compared to yield an experimental determination of the magnitude of the sum of nonlinear interactions and dissipation in short gravity waves. If the steady-state energy input in the neighbourhood of the dominant wave occurs at the measured initial temporal growth rates, then most of the energy input is locally dissipated; relatively little is advected away. Calculated gravitycapillary nonlinear energy transfer rates match those determined from initial growth rates for 9·8 cm waves and the gravity–capillary wave interaction continues to be significant for waves as long as 16·5 cm. For longer waves the gravity–capillary interaction is too small to bring the short gravity wave to a steady state when it is the dominant wave of the wind-wave system. © 1977, Cambridge University Press.

An experimental verification of this theory is sought especially. A wind–wave facility 115 ft. long, 6 ft. high and 3 ft. wide was used. The facility is equipped with an oscil-lating-plate wave-generator which is capable of generating sinusoidal or arbitrary wave-forms, and a suction fan which can produce wind velocities up to 80 ft./sec when the water is at a nominal depth of 3 ft. The pressure sensor used for the measurements of pressure, was mounted on an oscillating device such that the sensor could be maintained at a fixed small distance (within 1/4 in.) above a propagating wavy surface at all times. The perturbation pressure over progressive waves is extracted from recorded data sensed by the moving sensor. The results compare favourably with the theoretical predictions of Miles (1959).},

	abstract = {A joint experiment to study microscale fluctuations of atmospheric pressure above surface gravity waves was conducted in the Bight of Abaco, Bahamas, during November and December 1974. Field hardware included a three-dimensional array of six wave sensors and seven air-pressure sensors, one of which was mounted on a wave follower. The primary objectives of the study were to resolve differences in previous field measurements by Dobson (1971), Elliott (1972b) and Snyder (1974), and to estimate the vertical profile of wave-induced pressure and the corresponding input of energy and momentum to the wave field. Analysis of a pre-experiment intercalibration of instruments and of 30 h of field data partially removes the discrepancy between the previous measurements of the wave-induced component of the pressure and gives a consistent picture of the profile of this pressure over a limited range of dimensionless height and wind speed. Over this range the pressure decays approximately exponentially without change of phase; the decay is slightly less steep than predicted by potential theory. The corresponding momentum transfer is positive for wind speeds exceeding the phase speed. Extrapolation of present results to higher frequencies suggests that the total transfer is a significant fraction of the wind stress (0.1 to 1.0, depending on dimensionless fetch). Analysis of the turbulent component of the atmospheric pressure shows that the ‘intrinsic’ downwind coherence scale is typically an order-of-magnitude greater than the crosswind scale, consistent with a ‘frozen’ turbulence hypothesis. These and earlier data of Priestley (1965) and Elliott (1972c) suggest a horizontally isotropic ‘intrinsic ’turbulent pressure spectrum which decays as k-v where k is the (horizontal) wave-number and v is typically —2 to — 3; estimates of this spectrum are computed for the present data. The implications of these findings for Phillips’ (1957) theory of wave growth are examined. © 1981, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A mechanism for the generation of surface waves by a parallel shear flow U(y) is developed on the basis of the inviscid Orr-Sommerfeld equation. It is found that the rate at which energy is transferred to a wave of speed c is proportional to the profile curvature -U“(y) at that elevation where U = c. The result is applied to the generation of deep-water gravity waves by wind. An approximate solution to the boundary value problem is developed for a logarithmic profile and the corresponding spectral distribution of the energy transfer coefficient calculated as a function of wave speed. The minimum wind speed for the initiation of gravity waves against laminar dissipation in water having negligible mean motion is found to be roughly 100cm/sec. A spectral mean value of the sheltering coefficient, as defined by Munk, is found to be in order-of-magnitude agreement with total wave drag measurements of Van Dorn. It is concluded that the model yields results in qualitative agreement with observation, but truly quantitative comparisons would require a more accurate solution of the boundary value problem and more precise data on wind profiles than are presently available.

	abstract = {The effect of white capping on the spectral energy balance of surface waves is investigated by expressing the white-cap interactions in terms of an equivalent ensemble of random pressure pulses. It is shown first that the source function for any non-expansible interaction process which is weak-in-the-mean is quasi-linear. In the case of white capping, the damping coefficient is then shown to be proportional to the square of the frequency, provided the wave scales are large compared with the white-cap dimensions. The remaining free factor is determined indirectly from consideration of the spectral energy balance. The proposed white-capping dissipation function is consistent with the structure of the energy balance derived from JONSWAP, and the existence of a δ-5 spectrum governed by a non-local energy balance between the atmospheric input, the nonlinear energy transfer and dissipation. However, closure of the energy balance involves hypotheses regarding the structure of the atmospheric input function which need to be tested by further measurements. The proposed set of source functions may nevertheless be useful for numerical wave-prediction. According to the model, nearly all the momentum transferred across the air-sea interface enters the wave field. For fetchlimited and fully developed spectra in a stationary, uniform wind field, the drag coefficient remains approximately constant. However, for more general wind conditions, this will not be the case and the wave spectrum should be included in an accurate parameterisation of the air-sea momentum transfer. © 1974 D.

	abstract = {Turbulent fluxes at the air-sea interface are estimated with data collected in 2011 to 2017 with a low-profile platform during six experiments in four regions. The observations were carried out with moderate winds (2–10 m/s) and averaged wave heights of 1.5 m. Most of the time, there was a swell, with an averaged wave age (the ratio between wave phase speed and wind speed) being equal to 2.8 ± 1.6. Three flux calculation methods are used, namely, the eddy covariance (EC), the inertial dissipation (ID), and the bulk methods. For the EC method, a spectral technique is proposed to correct wind data from platform motion. A mean bias affecting the friction velocity (u*) is then evaluated. The comparison between EC u* and ID u* estimates suggests that a constant imbalance term (ϕimb) equal to 0.4 is required in the ID method, possibly due to wave influence on our data. Overall, the confidence in the calculated u* estimates is found to be on the order of 10\%. The values of the drag coefficient (CD) are in good agreement with the parameterizations of Smith (1988, https://doi.org/10.1029/JC093iC12p15467) in medium-range winds and of Edson et al.

Water wave height and fluctuating air pressure were measured simultaneously in a fixed reference frame as a function of fetch in the Stanford Wind, Water-Wave Research Facility under the conditions of a steady wind and a stationary wave spectrum. All the data were obtained 5 mm above the highest point of the wind waves for five stations (3 m apart on average) and at three wind speeds (7.1, 8.0 and 8.9 m/sec). The wave height and fluctuating pressure were measured by a capacitance wave-height gauge and a crystal pressure transducer, respectively.

Barnett's approximate parametric equation for calculating the energy transfer of nonlinear wave-wave interaction and Hasselmann's white-capping dissipation model were also verified and appeared to be applicable in the relatively low and intermediate frequency region of a wave spectrum for a normalized fetch range of 100-500. Based on the results of an overall energy balance in a gravity wind-wave spectrum, the nonlinear wave-wave interaction mechanism is shown to play a dominant role in the energy transfer processes after the wave spectrum is generated. © 1979.},

	abstract = {A higher‐order perturbation theory for the modulation of short gravity waves by longer‐scale periodic flows is developed, starting with Boltzmann's transport equation and including the input from the wind, energy transfer by nonlinear resonant interactions, and dissipation. Specific results are given for a model dealing with the straining of short gravity waves coupled to ‘parasitic’ capillary waves by second‐order resonant interactions. The initial value problem yields a relaxation rate for the short gravity waves equal to their growth rate. The predicted phase of the short gravity waves in relation to the crest of the longer gravity waves with this relaxation rate is in better agreement with measurements. Explicit expressions are obtained for the second‐order results in terms of Uo/C (ratio of orbital to phase speed of the modulating wave). Numerical results are obtained for the reduction of the short gravity waves amplitude and for the modulation and phase of the backscattered power of microwave sensors probing this system of water waves. The second‐order results predict the reduction of the linear modulations, but the reduction is not large enough to match the measurements for Uo/C ratios larger than 0.1. Accordingly, perturbation solutions do not converge fast enough for the larger Uo/C ratios. This paper is not subject to U.S. copyright. Published in 1979 by the American Geophysical Union.},

This novel sensing approach is proposed, whereby we attempt to determine the oncoming flow velocity magnitude and direction from measurements of the power required by each of the MUAS rotors. Extensive wind-tunnel testing was completed to determine the power required by the fore and aft rotor-pairs at varying flow velocities and directions. The results show that it is possible to map between rotor power consumption and the oncoming flow vectors, however, a unique and accurate mapping is only possible over a very small region of the measurement space. Thus, it is concluded that the practical use of this sensing method is limited. Examination of power consumption curves also revealed that the conditions under which a Vortex Ring State (VRS) develops for small MUAS. The characteristics of VRS development are similar to those of full-size helicopters, indicating that the VRS is Reynolds number independent. The reduction in power consumption due to the presence of updraft flows of various magnitudes was also quantified, indicating that significant endurance improvements of MUAS are possible and can be achieved when operating windward of large buildings.},

	abstract = {IT is common knowledge among seafarers that rain "knocks down the sea"1,2 or that surface-wave breaking is suppressed by heavy rain. Although no quantitative data exist, several mechanisms have been proposed that might account for the attenuation of waves by rain. The most likely seems to be that raindrops produce turbulence in the water which then helps to dissipate the waves. Here we describe laboratory experiments which show that, in the absence of wind, rain preferentially damps short-wavelength gravity waves. The observed damping rates are, however, lower than earlier predictions3,4. The suppression of short waves has an effect on the sea surface similar to that of an oil film, leading to a reduction in the breaking of long waves. The phenomenon is important because it helps to provide insight into other aspects of wave breaking or wave suppression, and because of its bearing on the detection and estimation of rainfall at sea from ambient noise levels5, and of the measurement of winds using radar, as scatterometer estimates of wind speed are known to be biased when it rains6. Wind speed is determined from an empirical relation with the observed strength of the backscattered radar signal. Although the signal may be influenced by atmospheric effects in rain, the very-small-scale roughness of the surface caused by rain drops or, as we shall show, the reduction of the 10-cm-scale waves, may also affect the signal and hence the wind-speed estimate.},

The emerging wind–wave field varies in time as well as in space. Detailed knowledge of wave parameter distributions under those conditions contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms of wind wave generation. In the present study, the instantaneous surface elevation and two components of the instantaneous surface slope were recorded at various fetches in a small-scale experimental facility under nearly impulsive wind forcing. Numerous independent realizations have been recorded for each selection of operational conditions. Sufficient data at a number of fetches were accumulated to calculate reliable ensemble-averaged statistical parameters of the evolving random wind–wave field as a function of the time elapsed from activation of wind forcing. Distinct stages in the wave evolution process from appearance of initial ripples to emergence of a quasi-steady wind–wave field were identified.

	abstract = {The subject of turbulence, the most forbidding in fluid dynamics, has usually proved treacherous to the beginner, caught in the whirls and eddies of its nonlinearities and statistical imponderables. This is the first book specifically designed to offer the student a smooth transitionary course between elementary fluid dynamics (which gives only last-minute attention to turbulence) and the professional literature on turbulent flow, where an advanced viewpoint is assumed. Moreover, the text has been developed for students, engineers, and scientists with different technical backgrounds and interests. Almost all flows, natural and man-made, are turbulent. Thus the subject is the concern of geophysical and environmental scientists (in dealing with atmospheric jet streams, ocean currents, and the flow of rivers, for example), of astrophysicists (in studying the photospheres of the sun and stars or mapping gaseous nebulae), and of engineers (in calculating pipe flows, jets, or wakes). Many such examples are discussed in the book. The approach taken avoids the difficulties of advanced mathematical development on the one side and the morass of experimental detail and empirical data on the other. As a result of following its midstream course, the text gives the student a physical understanding of the subject and deepens his intuitive insight into those problems that cannot now be rigorously solved. In particular, dimensional analysis is used extensively in dealing with those problems whose exact solution is mathematically elusive. Dimensional reasoning, scale arguments, and similarity rules are introduced at the beginning and are applied throughout. A discussion of Reynolds stress and the kinetic theory of gases provides the contrast needed to put mixing-length theory into proper perspective: the authors present a thorough comparison between the mixing-length models and dimensional analysis of shear flows. This is followed by an extensive treatment of vorticity dynamics, including vortex stretching and vorticity budgets. Two chapters are devoted to boundary-free shear flows and well-bounded turbulent shear flows. The examples presented include wakes, jets, shear layers, thermal plumes, atmospheric boundary layers, pipe and channel flow, and boundary layers in pressure gradients. The spatial structure of turbulent flow has been the subject of analysis in the book up to this point, at which a compact but thorough introduction to statistical methods is given. This prepares the reader to understand the stochastic and spectral structure of turbulence. The remainder of the book consists of applications of the statistical approach to the study of turbulent transport (including diffusion and mixing) and turbulent spectra.},

Our measurements show that for each experiment, the mean surface drift directly induced by the wind on the upwind faces and crests of these waves is (\$0.23{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}pm\}{\textbackslash},0.02\$)\$\{u\}{\textasciicircum}a\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ in the trough increasing to (\$0.33{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}pm\}{\textbackslash},0.07\$)\$\{u\}{\textasciicircum}a\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ at the crest, where \$\{u\}{\textasciicircum}a\_{\textbackslash}ast\$ is the wind friction velocity.

Here we use ocean-atmosphere-land satellite observations to reveal the dominant contribution of the MC monsoonal water cycle to boreal winter−spring freshening in the Java Sea through local precipitation and runoff from Kalimantan, Indonesia. We further demonstrate that the freshening corresponds to a reduced southward pressure gradient that would weaken the ITF. Therefore, the MC water cycle plays a critical role regulating ITF seasonality. The findings have strong implications to longer-term variations of the ITF associated with the variability and change of Indo-Pacific climate and MC water cycle.},

	abstract = {We present the results of laboratory and field measurements on the stability of wind-driven water surfaces. The laboratory measurements show that when exposed to an increasing wind starting from rest, surface current and wave generation is accompanied by a variety of phenomena that occur over comparable space and time scales. Of particular interest is the generation of small-scale, streamwise vortices, or Langmuir circulations, the clear influence of the circulations on the structure of the growing wave field, and the subsequent transition to turbulence of the surface flow. Following recent work by Melville, Shear \&amp; Veron (1998) and Veron \&amp; Melville (1999b), we show that the waves that are initially generated by the wind are then strongly modulated by the Langmuir circulations that follow. Direct measurements of the modulated wave variables are qualitatively consistent with geometrical optics and wave action conservation, but quantitative comparison remains elusive. Within the range of parameters of the experiments, both the surface waves and the Langmuir circulations first appear at constant Reynolds numbers of 370 ± 10 and 530 ± 20, respectively, based on the surface velocity and the depth of the laminar shear layer. The onset of the Langmuir circulations leads to a significant increase in the heat transfer across the surface. The field measurements in a boat basin display the same phenomena that are observed in the laboratory. The implications of the measurements for air–sea fluxes, especially heat and gas transfer, and sea-surface temperature, are discussed.},

	abstract = {A laboratory investigation has been undertaken to quantify water wave attenuation rates as a function of rainfall rate. Vertical artificial rainfall is shown to generate weak near-surface velocity fluctuations that decline systematically away from the free surface and are independent of rainfall rate across the range of rainfall rates investigated (40– ￼ \$170{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mm\} {\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h\} \}{\textasciicircum}\{- 1\} \$ ). In the absence of rain, the observed attenuation of gravity waves is at levels consistent with classical viscous theory, but with a systematic finite-amplitude effect observed above a mean steepness of 0.10. Wave attenuation rates were found to be independent of the mean wave steepness and identical when artificial rainfall rates of 108 and ￼ \$141{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mm\} {\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h\} \}{\textasciicircum}\{- 1\} \$ were applied. Reassessment of complementary theoretical and experimental studies of individual droplets impacting on undisturbed water surfaces indicates that above a weak threshold rainfall rate of ￼ \$30{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mm\} {\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h\} \}{\textasciicircum}\{- 1\} \$ , the surface irradiation becomes so frequent that droplet-generated violent surface motions directly interact with the incoming droplets. Present evidence is that a matching of time scales develops between the incoming surface irradiation and surface water motions generated by antecedent droplets as the rainfall rate increases. Consequently, at high rainfall rates, a highly dissipative surface regime is created that transmits little of the incident rainfall kinetic energy to the aqueous layers below. Rainfall-induced wave attenuation rates are compared with measurements of other wave attenuation processes to obtain a hierarchy of strength in both the laboratory and the field. Comparison is also made with wave attenuation theories that incorporate momentum and energy flux considerations. Rain-induced wave attenuation rates are weak or very strong depending on whether they are expressed in terms of energy scaling obtained from above or below the surface respectively, due to the high dissipation rate that occurs in the vicinity of the interface.},

The radar backscatter depends on the small-scale roughness of the sea surface. This is modified by the generation of capillary and gravity-capillary ripples by raindrops and by the increased damping of the wavelengths of 10-cm scale. The phenomenon is also important in wave generation and wave breaking, since in both cases the short wavelengths play a key role. A laboratory experiment has been performed to investigate the damping of water waves by rain in the absence of wind. Rain of intensity of 300 mm h−1 falls on mechanically generated progressive waves. The wave amplitude is measured before the wave enters and after it exits the rain section of a tank 2.35 m long. On the assumption of exponential damping, it is found that the effect of rain can be described by an eddy viscosity νE ≈ 0.3 cm2 s−1. The major part of the damping is attrib...},

The theory is based on a kinetic approach whereby individual drops are modelled as point particles with mass and velocity, and are described collectively by a distribution function \$f(t,{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{x\},{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\},r)\$ . We show that the resulting momentum flux can be readily incorporated into free-surface Navier–Stokes and Euler models. As an illustration of this approach we examine the interaction between rainfall and linear deep-water surface waves. This particular application is not fundamentally different from the study of Le Méhauté \&amp; Khangaonkar ( J. Phys. Oceanogr. , vol. 20 (12), 1990, pp. 1805–1812), but our methodology is more general and is novel in its use of a kinetic approach with an all-purpose drop distribution function. The applicability of the model to linear surface waves is found to be valid for surface-wave wavelengths ranging from approximately 3 to 250 m. We further show that rainfall modifies the usual wave dispersion relationship and induces wave amplification, or damping, depending on the rain rate, the rain impact angle and the wavelength of the surface wave. We solve for the amplification and damping rates analytically and show, among other results, that rain falling vertically will always damp the surface waves.},

Revealing atmospheric teleconnection patterns and understanding their underlying mechanisms is of great importance for weather forecasting in general and extreme-event prediction in particular3,4, especially considering that the characteristics of extreme events have been suggested to change under ongoing anthropogenic climate change5–8. Here we reveal the global coupling pattern of extreme-rainfall events by applying complex-network methodology to high-resolution satellite data and introducing a technique that corrects for multiple-comparison bias in functional networks. We find that the distance distribution of significant connections (P {\textless} 0.005) around the globe decays according to a power law up to distances of about 2,500 kilometres. For longer distances, the probability of significant connections is much higher than expected from the scaling of the power law. We attribute the shorter, power-law-distributed connections to regional weather systems. The longer, super-power-law-distributed connections form a global rainfall teleconnection pattern that is probably controlled by upper-level Rossby waves. We show that extreme-rainfall events in the monsoon systems of south-central Asia, east Asia and Africa are significantly synchronized. Moreover, we uncover concise links between south-central Asia and the European and North American extratropics, as well as the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Analysis of the atmospheric conditions that lead to these teleconnections confirms Rossby waves as the physical mechanism underlying these global teleconnection patterns and emphasizes their crucial role in dynamical tropical–extratropical couplings. Our results provide insights into the function of Rossby waves in creating stable, global-scale dependencies of extreme-rainfall events, and into the potential predictability of associated natural hazards.},

Particle image velocimetry is employed to analyze the velocity fields below individual waves, and a threshold for the vorticity on the leeward side of the crest is used to assess active wave breaking. Keeping the liquid flow rate constant, we analyze five experimental cases with increasing gas flow rates. The cases span the flow map from when first interfacial waves are observed, to the “amplitude saturation” regime, where the rms interface elevation is independent of the gas flow rate. While some wave breaking events are observed also in the wave-growth regime, wave breaking is found to be much more frequent when the gas flow rate is increased into the amplitude saturation regime, and 35\%-40\% of the waves passing the measurement section are assessed to be in a state of active breaking in this regime.

We show that this behaviour is a consequence of finite wave amplitude and is the angular analogue of Stokes drift. We derive expressions for both the preferred orientation of the particles, which depends only on particle shape, and the amplitude of the oscillation about this preferred value, which additionally depends on the wave parameters and the depth of the particle in the water column.},

	abstract = {Using a numerical model, we analyse the effects of shape on both the orientation and transport of anisotropic particles in wavy flows. The particles are idealized as prolate and oblate spheroids, and we consider the regime of small Stokes and particle Reynolds numbers. We find that the particles preferentially align into the shear plane with a mean orientation that is solely a function of their aspect ratio. This alignment, however, differs from the Jeffery orbits that occur in the residual shear flow (that is, the Stokes drift velocity field) in the absence of waves. Since the drag on an anisotropic particle depends on its alignment with the flow, this preferred orientation determines the effective drag on the particles, which in turn impacts their net downstream transport. We also find that the rate of alignment of the particles is not constant and depends strongly on their initial orientation; thus, variations in initial particle orientation result in dispersion of anisotropic-particle plumes. We show that this dispersion is a function of the particle’s eccentricity and the ratio of the settling and wave time scales. Due to this preferential alignment, we find that a plume of anisotropic particles in waves is on average transported farther but dispersed less than it would be if the particles were randomly oriented. Our results demonstrate that accurate prediction of the transport of anisotropic particles in wavy environments, such as microplastic particles in the ocean, requires the consideration of these preferential alignment effects.},

The presence of the ship causes the airflow to a particular instrument site to be either accelerated or decelerated, displaced vertically, and sometimes deflected slightly in the horizontal. Although recognized for some time, it is only recently that the problem has been addressed using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to simulate the flow over particular ships, quantify the effects of flow distortion, and hence correct the ship-based measurements. It has previously been shown that this improves the calculated momentum fluxes by removing disparities between data from different ships, or from instruments in different locations on the same ship.

River plumes often feature turbulent processes in the frontal zone and interfacial region at base of the plume, which ultimately impact spreading and mixing rates with the ambient coastal ocean. The degree to which these processes govern overall plume mixing is yet to be quantified with microstructure observations. A field campaign was conducted in a river plume in the northeast Gulf of Mexico in December 2013, in order to assess mixing processes that could potentially impact transport and dispersion of surface material near coastal regions. Current velocity, density, and Turbulent Kinetic Energy Values, ε, were obtained using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), a Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) profiler, a Vertical Microstructure Profiler (VMP), and two Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADVs). The frontal region contained ε values on the order of 10 -5 m 2 s -3 , which were markedly larger than in the ambient water beneath (O 10 -9 m 2 s -3 ). An energetic wake of moderate ε values (O 10 -6 m 2 s -3 ) was observed trailing the frontal edge. The interfacial region of an interior section of the plume featured opposing horizontal velocities and a ε value on the order of 10 -6 m 2 s -3 . A simplified mixing budget was used under significant assumptions to compare contributions from wind, tides, and frontal regions of the plume. The results from this order of magnitude analysis indicated that frontal processes (59\%) dominated in overall mixing. This emphasizes the importance of adequate parameterization of river plume frontal processes in coastal predictive models.},

The vertical scale of the best-fit distribution is proportional to the wave height times the surf similarity parameter for the steeper beaches in accordance with Hunt's formula for runup of regular waves on structures. For flat beaches, however, the vertical scale of the distribution is independent of the beach slope. The base level for the best-fit distribution (i.e. the highest level transgressed by all incoming wave crests) is indistinguishable from the still water level on the steep beaches but significantly lower on flat beaches. The demarcation between "steep" and "flat" beaches in these respects is at a beach face slope of approximately 0.10. The level of the shoreline relative to the runup distribution is a decreasing function of the beach slope.},

In this study, background error covariance assumptions in the 3DVar assimilation process are perturbed to understand the effect on the solution relative to the withheld dense drifter data. Results show that the amplitude of the background error covariance is an important factor as expected, and a proposed new formulation provides added skill. In addition, the background error covariance time correlation is important to allow satellite observations to affect the results over a period longer than one daily assimilation cycle. The results show the new background error covariance formulations provide more accurate placement of frontal positions, directions of currents and velocity magnitudes.

Our understanding of temperature dissipation rate χ within the upper ocean boundary layer, which is critical for climate forecasts, is very limited. Near-surface turbulence also affects dispersion of contaminants and biogeochemical tracers. Using high-resolution optical turbulence measurements, scaling laws for χ are investigated under forcing states where either the daytime heat flux or the wind stress forcing is dominant. We find that χ remains constant over 1.5 times the significant wave height, while over a layer below, χ decays based on the local surface forcing. When the heat flux is dominant, traditional scaling based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory remains valid; χ â? z -1 . When the wind stress dominates, we observe the emergence of a new scaling, χ â? z -1/2 , which is explained by invoking the effect of small-scale coherent structures on vertical heat transport.

	abstract = {Tropical cyclone track prediction is steadily improving, while storm intensity prediction has seen little progress in the last quarter century. Important physics are not yet well understood and implemented in tropical cyclone forecast models. Missing and unresolved physics, especially at the air-sea interface, are among the factors limiting storm predictions. In a laboratory experiment and coordinated numerical simulation, conducted in this work, the microstructure of the air-water interface under hurricane force wind resembled Kelvin-Helmholtz shear instability between fluids with a large density difference. Supported by these observations, we bring forth the concept that the resulting two-phase environment suppresses short gravity-capillary waves and alters the aerodynamic properties of the sea surface. The unified wave-form and two-phase parameterization model shows the well-known increase of the drag coefficient (Cd) with wind speed, up to {\textasciitilde}30 ms(-1). Around 60 ms(-1), the new parameterization predicts a local peak of Ck/Cd, under constant enthalpy exchange coefficient Ck. This peak may explain rapid intensification of some storms to major tropical cyclones and the previously reported local peak of lifetime maximum intensity (bimodal distribution) in the best-track records. The bimodal distribution of maximum lifetime intensity, however, can also be explained by environmental parameters of tropical cyclones alone.},

Discus buoys modified for the measurement of momentum flux were deployed during the Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment and the High Resolution Remote Sensing Programme. Successful evaluation of the wind stress was carried out in moderate sea conditions: wind speed and significant wave height, respectively, reaching 12 m s-1 and 4.25 m.

This stratification is found to be due to lateral straining. We observe a strong single-cell lateral circulation, which is strongly pronounced at late-flood and absent during most of ebb. This tidal asymmetry is caused by a systematic interplay between centrifugal forcing and the lateral baroclinic pressure gradient. During flood a positive feedback between the terms generates strong lateral circulation, whereas during ebb a negative feedback leads to a suppression of the cross-channel exchange. A theoretical framework based on vorticity is developed, which allows lateral and longitudinal circulation to be studied in a consistent way. With this framework it is possible to show that the tidal asymmetry of the lateral flow is a major driver of residual longitudinal estuarine circulation, here identified with ...},

	abstract = {In the summer and fall of 2012, during the GLAD experiment in the Gulf of Mexico, the Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) used several ocean models to assist the deployment of more than 300 surface drifters. The Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) at 1 km and 3 km resolutions, the US Navy operational NCOM at 3. km resolution (AMSEAS), and two versions of the Hybrid Coordinates Ocean Model (HYCOM) set at 4. km were running daily and delivering 72-h range forecasts. They all assimilated remote sensing and local profile data but they were not assimilating the drifter's observations. This work presents a non-intrusive methodology named Multi-Model Ensemble Kalman Filter that allows assimilating the local drifter data into such a set of models, to produce improved ocean currents forecasts. The filter is to be used when several modeling systems or ensembles are available and/or observations are not entirely handled by the operational data assimilation process. It allows using generic in situ measurements over short time windows to improve the predictability of local ocean dynamics and associated high-resolution parameters of interest for which a forward model exists (e.g. oil spill plumes). Results can be used for operational applications or to derive enhanced background fields for other data assimilation systems, thus providing an expedite method to non-intrusively assimilate local observations of variables with complex operators. Results for the GLAD experiment show the method can improve water velocity predictions along the observed drifter trajectories, hence enhancing the skills of the models to predict individual trajectories.},

	abstract = {Marine oil spills can have dire consequences for the environment. Research on their dynamics is important for the well-being of coastal communities and their economies. Propagation of oil spills is a very complex physical-chemical process. As seen during the Deepwater Horizon event in the Gulf of Mexico during 2010, one of the critical problems remaining for prediction of oil transport and dispersion in the marine environment is the small-scale structure and dynamics of surface oil spills. The laboratory experi- ments conducted in this work were focused on understanding the differences between the dynamics of crude and weathered oil spills and the effect of dispersants. After deposition on the still water surface, a drop of crude oil quickly spread into a thin slick; while at the same time, a drop of machine (proxy for weathered) oil did not show significant evolution. Subsequent application of dispersant to the crude oil slick resulted in a quick contraction or fragmentation of the slick into narrow wedges and tiny drops. Notably, the slick of machine oil did not show significant change in size or topology after spraying dispersant. An advanced multi-phase, volume of fluid computational fluid dynamics model, incorporating capillary forces, was able to explain some of the features observed in the laboratory experiment. As a result of the laboratory and modeling experiments, the new interpretation of the effect of dispersant on the oil dispersion process including capillary effects has been proposed, which is expected to lead to improved oil spill models and response strategies.},

The new method is shown to have superior performance to various other methods and it has the added advantage that it requires no parameters.

The free constants in several interpolation formulas can be adjusted to give excellent fits to the wind and temperature gradient data.

Three methods for determining the tilt angles relative to a mean streamline coordinate system and for computing the tilt-corrected stresses are then compared. The most commonly used method, involving a double rotation of the anemometers' axes, is shown to result in significant run-to-run stress errors due to the sampling uncertainty of the mean vertical velocity. An alternative method, requiring a triple rotation of the anemometer axes, is shown to result in even greater run-to-run stress errors due to the combined sampling errors of the mean vertical velocity and the cross-wind stress. For measurements over the sea where the cross-stream stress is important, the double rotation method is shown to overestimate the surface stress, due to the uncorrected lateral tilt component. A third method, using a planar fit technique, isshown to reduce the run-to-run stress errors due to sampling effects, and provides an unbiased estimate of the lateral stress.},

These images of the surface gradient can be integrated to recover the shape of the water surface and find the two-dimensional wavenumber spectrum. Waveforms and two-dimensional structures of short wind waves have many interesting features: short and steep waves featuring sharp troughs and flat crests are very commonly seen and most of the short waves are far less steep than the limiting wave forms ; waveforms that resemble capillary-gravity solitons are observed with a close match to the form theoretically predicted for potential flows (Longuet-Higgins 1989); capillaries are mainly found as parasitics on the downwind faces of gravity waves, and the longest wavelengths of those parasitic capillaries found are less than 1 cm; the phenomenon of capillary blockage (Phillips 1981) on dispersive freely travelling short waves is also observed. The spectra of short waves generated by low winds show a characteristic dip at the transition wavenumber between the gravity and capillary regimes, and the dip becomes filled in as the wind increases. The spectral cut-off at high wavenumbers shows a power law behaviour with an exponent of about minus four. The wavenumber of the transition from the dip to the cut-off is not sensitive to the change of wind speed. The minus fourth power law of the extreme capillary wind wave spectrum can be explained through a model of energy balances. The concept of an equilibrium spectrum is still useful. It is shown that the dip in the spectrum of capillary-gravity waves is a result of blockage of both capillary-gravity wind waves and parasitic capillary waves.},

	abstract = {Despite its importance for momentum and mass transfer across the air-sea interface, the dynamics of airflow over breaking waves is largely unknown. To fill this gap, velocity and vorticity distributions above short-gravity breaking waves have been measured in a wind-wave tank. A Digital Particle Image velocimetry technique (DPIV) was developed to accomplish these measurements above single breaking waves, propagating in mechanically-generated wave groups and forced by the wind. By varying the wind speed and initial characteristics of the groups, the airflow structure was captured over waves at different stages of the breaking process, and breaking with various intensities. The instantaneous airflow that separates from a sharp breaking crest is very similar to that occurring over a backward facing step. The separation bubble is however strongly unsteady: the steeper the wave crest and the larger the Reynolds number based on the crest-height, the higher the separated layer and the farther downwind the reattachment point. Instantaneous flow topology displays specific features of three-dimensional separation patterns. The tangential stress above the wave profile does not exhibit spikes at reattachment but grows progressively downwind from zero at reattachment to a value at the next crest approximately that found at the upwind breaking crest. Static pressure measurements revealed that large pressure falls are generated by vortices in the separated layer, as found in separated flows over solids. This study may provide useful data for theoretical and numerical modelling of the flow and associated phenomena.},

The Lagrangian Submesoscale Experiment (LASER) involved the deployment of {\textasciitilde}1000 biodegradable GPS-tracked Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) drifters to measure submesoscale upper-ocean currents and their potential impact on oil spills. The experiment was conducted from January to February 2016 in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) near the mouth of the Mississippi River, an area characterized by strong submesoscale currents. A Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG) marine X-band radar (MR) on board the R/V F. G. Walton Smith was used to locate fronts and eddies by their sea surface roughness signatures. The MR data were further processed to yield near-surface current maps at {\textasciitilde}500-m resolution up to a maximum range of {\textasciitilde}3 km. This study employs the drifter measurements to perform the first comprehensive validation of MR near-surface current maps. For a total of 4130 MR-drifter pairs, the root-mean-square error for the current speed is 4 cm s -1 and that for the current direction is 12°. The MR samples currents at a greater effective depth than the CARTHE drifters (1-5 m vs {\textasciitilde}0.4 m). The mean MR-drifter differences are consistent with a wave- and wind-driven vertical current profile that weakens with increasing depth and rotates clockwise from the wind direction (by 0.7\% of the wind speed and 15°). The technique presented here has great potential in observational oceanography, as it allows research vessels to map the horizontal flow structure, complementing the vertical profiles measured by ADCP.},

Currently, only limited observational data exist that can be used to validate available droplet production models. To help fill this gap, a laboratory experiment was conducted that directly observed the vertical distribution of spume droplets above actively breaking waves. The experiments were carried out in hurricane-force conditions (10-m equivalent wind speed of 36–54 m s−1), and the observed particles ranged in radius r from 80 to nearly 1400 μm. High-resolution profiles (3 mm) were reconstructed from optical imagery taken within the boundary layer, ranging from 2 to 6 times the local significant wave height. Number concentrations were observed to have a radius dependence proportional to r−3 leading to spume production estimates that diverge from typical source models, which tend to exhibit a radius falloff closer to r−8. This was particularly significant for droplets with radii circa 1 mm whose modeled production rates were several orders of magnitude less than the rates expected from the observed concentrations. The vertical dependence of the number concentrations was observed to follow a logarithmic profile, which does not confirm the power-law relationship expected by a conventional spume generation parameterization. These observations bear significant implications for efforts to characterize the role these large droplets play in boundary layer processes under high-wind conditions.},

In our illustrative example, the current magnitude averaged over the upper 1 cm of the ocean is shown to be nearly four times the average over the upper 10 m, even for mild forcing.

This paper endeavors to expand on the body of laboratory wave modulation data and extend the investigation in support of the radar remote sensing of ocean surface waves. Measurements were made in the University of Miami's surge-structure-atmosphere interaction facility in the air-sea interaction saltwater tank wind-wave tank, with 10 m referenced wind speeds ranging between 5 and 23 m/s and paddle-generated wave steepnesses 'ak' varying between 0.05 {\textless} ak {\textless} 0.3. A polarimetric camera was used to capture high sampling frequency maps of wave slope, yielding spatiotemporal information about short wind-wave behavior [provided as temporal variations in the wavenumber spectrum, where κ ≈ (100-1000) rad/m]. The simultaneous and colocated long wave phase was measured via a side-looking camera. Hydrodynamic modulation transfer function (MTF) phases are found to be in general agreement with established values (between 2 and 10 radians) at the given wind speeds. The positive phase of the modulation places it immediately downwind of the long wave crest, with MTF magnitudes strongest for high wavenumbers at the lowest wind speeds. The results are also presented to show the modulation of gravity-capillary and pure capillary waves as variations in mean square slope over the long wave phase, with peak roughness enhancement found to move upwind of the long wave crest with increasing wind forcing.},

	abstract = {Floating oil, plastics, and marine organisms are continually redistributed by ocean surface currents. Prediction of their resulting distribution on the surface is a fundamental, long-standing, and practically important problem. The dominant paradigm is dispersion within the dynamical context of a nondivergent flow: objects initially close together will on average spread apart but the area of surface patches of material does not change. Although this paradigm is likely valid at mesoscales, larger than 100 km in horizontal scale, recent theoretical studies of submesoscales (less than ∼10 km) predict strong surface convergences and downwelling associated with horizontal density fronts and cyclonic vortices. Here we show that such structures can dramatically concentrate floating material. More than half of an array of ∼200 surface drifters covering ∼20 × 20 km2 converged into a 60 × 60 m region within a week, a factor of more than 105 decrease in area, before slowly dispersing. As predicted, the convergence occurred at density fronts and with cyclonic vorticity. A zipperlike structure may play an important role. Cyclonic vorticity and vertical velocity reached 0.001 s-1 and 0.01 ms-1, respectively, which is much larger than usually inferred. This suggests a paradigm in which nearby objects form submesoscale clusters, and these clusters then spread apart. Together, these effects set both the overall extent and the finescale texture of a patch of floating material. Material concentrated at submesoscale convergences can create unique communities of organisms, amplify impacts of toxic material, and create opportunities to more efficiently recover such material.},

	abstract = {Targeted observations of submesoscale currents are necessary to improve science's understanding of oceanic mixing, but these dynamics occur at spatiotemporal scales that are currently challenging to detect. Prior studies have recently shown that the submesoscale surface velocity field can be measured by tracking hundreds of surface drifters released in tight arrays. This strategy requires drifter positioning to be accurate, frequent, and to last for several weeks. However, because of the large numbers involved, drifters must be low-cost, compact, easy to handle, and also made of materials harmless to the environment. Therefore, the novel Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE) drifter was designed following these criteria to facilitate massive sampling of near-surface currents during the Lagrangian Submesoscale Experiment (LASER). The drifting characteristics were determined under a wide range of currents, waves, and wind conditions in laboratory settings. Results showed that the drifter accurately follows the currents in the upper 0.60 m, that it presents minimal wave rectification issues, and that its wind-induced slip velocity is less than 0.5\% of the neutral wind speed at 10 m. In experiments conducted in both coastal and deep ocean conditions under wind speeds up to 10 m s-1, the trajectories of the traditional Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment (CODE) and the CARTHE drifters were nearly identical. Following these tests, 1100 units were produced and deployed during the LASER campaign, successfully tracking submesoscale and mesoscale features in the Gulf of Mexico. It is hoped that this drifter will enable high-density sampling near metropolitan areas subject to stress by the overpopulation, such as lakes, rivers, estuaries, and environmentally sensitive areas, such as the Arctic. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Measurements of wind speed and direction from the NASA Scatterometer and ocean reflectance from the POLDER multidirectional radiometer are used for a quantitative analysis of the ocean glint intensity and shape. These two instruments have been flying on board the ADEOS satellite platform, which assures a very large data set of coincident measurements distributed over all oceans. The glint intensity and pattern is directly related to the wave slope probability function. The slope distribution model developed by Cox and Munk (1954) more than half a century ago, which is a function of wind speed and direction, permits an excellent fit of the observation. In particular, the modeled mean square slope is in near perfect agreement with that derived from the satellite data. The latter permit, however, a novel analysis of the deviations from a pure Gaussian slope distribution. In particular, it is shown that the skewness is a nonlinear function of the wind speed. A typical glint reflectance in the specular direction is 0.2, which is therefore significantly smaller than, for instance, a typical cloud reflectance. There are large variations with the Sun zenith angle, however, that are easily accounted for with a simple formula. The glint reflectance allows an estimate of the wind speed that is highly correlated with the independent measurement from the scatterometer, with an estimated error less than 1 m s/sup -1/. The multidirectional reflectance measurements from POLDER also permit the retrieval of the wind direction, albeit only in favorable conditions depending on the respective orientation of the view and wind vectors},

Yet the information is sparse because it says nothing about time and space scales. The BH rules are an inconvenient sea truth, too fundamental to be ignored, too incomplete to be understood. With regard to BH rule 1 (BH:1), I suggest that the constant spread is associated with a wake-like geometry of the short gravities. Steepness linearity (BH:2) remains an enigma. Skewness (BH:3) appears to be correlated with a rather sudden onset of breaking for winds above 4 m s(-1). I do not think that skewness comes from parasitic capillaries.

	abstract = {Image analysis techniques are used for retrieving water surface elevation fields spatially and temporally from CCD-images and CCD-image-sequences. The technique proposed herein utilizes binocular stereogrammetry to recover topographic information from a sequence of synchronous, overlapping video images. The method used differs from the traditional stereo-photogrammetric analysis of a single stereo-pair because the use of video allows for a continuous sequence of stereo-images to be digitally sampled and analyzed. For data acquisition two synchronized progressive-scan cameras were used. A partially supervised 3-D stereo system (called WASS, Wave Acquisition Stereo System) is shown here. It is used to reconstruct the 3-D shape of water surface waves, acquired at frame rate, with small computational time needed. The stereo method is presented, including the derivation of a relationship relating the geometry of the stereo rig and the expected errors. Finally, the 3-D calculated scattered points give the complete spatio-temporal distribution of the water surface elevations. The measurable length-scales depend on the pixel resolution, the triangulation accuracy, and the acquisition frame rate. Limitations in the stereo measurements are also discussed. Two experiments to test and to demonstrate the system took place: one on the Venice lagoon, north of the city of Venice in September 2004 and the second on the coast of California at San Diego in December 2005. For the second experiment, qualitative and quantitative intercomparisons of the stereo-matching and in-situ sensor measurements are presented. All the measurements of water surface waves indicate that the proposed approach is both accurate and applicable for measuring water surface waves. Moreover, shape estimates are accurately and extremely dense both in space and time, and the remote location of the instruments alleviates some difficulties associated with in situ instrumentation.},

	abstract = {[1] A study is presented of modulations induced by a dominant long surface wave (LW) in the coupled airflow-short wind-generated waves (SW) system. The modulation of SWs in the gravity range results from their interaction with the LW orbital velocity and their interaction with the wind stress modulated by the LW. The modulation of waves in the capillary range is mainly due to the modulation of the rate of generation of parasitic capillaries by steep short gravity waves. The variation of the wind surface stress is described by the dynamics of the turbulent airflow over the LW with the surface roughness varying along its profile. The variation of the surface roughness is caused by the variation of the form drag supported by modulated SWs. In turn, the LW-induced variation of the surface stress affects the SW modulation. This provides a feedback in the coupled airflow-SW system in the presence of the LW. The model results show that the amplitude of the surface roughness modulation can be large. In terms of the modulation transfer function (MTF), it can reach values of 10-20. The modulation of the form drag, which causes the modulation of the surface roughness, comes mainly from short breaking waves strongly modulated by dominant waves. The modulation of the surface roughness considerably affects the dynamics of the airflow over the LW and thus the LW wind growth rate. Models of the airflow above waves assuming a constant roughness parameter underestimate the growth rate parameter approximately two to three times as compared to the measured values. The present study shows that when the variation in the surface roughness is accounted for, the growth rate parameter increases roughly twice, which to a large extent reduces the discrepancy with measurements.},

Methods of evaluating the frequency spectrum, directional spectrum and the component phase speed are given.

In contrast, waters on the continental shelf in East Antarctica are cooler and ice shelves experience relatively low rates of basal melt. An exception is provided by the Totten and Moscow University ice shelves on the Sabrina Coast, where satellite-derived basal melt rates are comparable to West Antarctica. Recent oceanographic observations have revealed that relatively warm (?20.48C) modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) enters the cavity beneath the Totten Ice Shelf through a 1100 mdeep trough, delivering sufficient heat to drive rapid basal melt. Here we use observa- tions from a recent summer survey to show that mCDW is widespread on the continental shelf of the Sabrina Coast, forming a warm (up to 0.38C) and saline (34.5–34.6) bottom layer overlaid by cold (?freezing point) and fresh (salinity ?34.3) Winter Water. Dense Shelf Water is not observed. A 1000 deepm trough allows water at 21.38C to reach the Moscow University ice-shelf cavity to drive basal melt. Freshening by addition of glacial meltwater is widespread on the southern shelf at depths above 300–400 m, with maximum meltwater concentrations up to 4–5 ml L21 observed in outflows from the ice-shelf cavities. Our observations indicate that the ocean properties on the Sabrina Coast more resemble those found on the continental shelf of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas than those typical of East Antarctica.},

	abstract = {Abstract Winds and waves in marine boundary layers are often in an unsettled state when fast-running swell generated by distant storms propagates into local regions and modifies the overlying turbulent fields. A large-eddy simulation (LES) model with the capability to resolve a moving sinusoidal wave at its lower boundary is developed to investigate this low-wind/fast-wave regime. It is used to simulate idealized situations with wind following and opposing fast-propagating waves (swell), and stationary bumps. LES predicts momentum transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere for wind following swell, and this can greatly modify the turbulence production mechanism in the marine surface layer. In certain circumstances the generation of a low-level jet reduces the mean shear between the surface layer and the PBL top, resulting in a near collapse of turbulence in the PBL. When light winds oppose the propagating swell, turbulence levels increase over the depth of the boundary layer and the surface drag increases by a factor of 4 compared to a flat surface. The mean wind profile, turbulence variances, and vertical momentum flux are then dependent on the state of the wave field. The LES results are compared with measurements from the Coupled Boundary Layers Air–Sea Transfer (CBLAST) field campaign. A quadrant analysis of the momentum flux from CBLAST verifies a wave age dependence predicted by the LES solutions. The measured bulk drag coefficient CD then depends on wind speed and wave state. In situations with light wind following swell, CD is approximately 50\% lower than values obtained from standard bulk parameterizations that have no sea state dependence. In extreme cases with light wind and persistent swell, CD {\textless} 0.},

The proposed formula is shown to predict well the magnitude and behavior of the drag coefficient as observed in wave tanks, lakes, and the open ocean, thus reconciling observations that previously had appeared disparate. Indeed, the formula suggests that changes in roughness due to limited duration or fetch are of order 10\% or less. Thus all deep water, pure windseas, regardless of fetch or duration, extract momentum from the air at a rate similar to that predicted for a fully developed sea. This is confirmed using published field data for a wide range of conditions over lakes and coastal seas. Only for field data corresponding to extremely young waves (U10/cp {\textgreater} 3) were there appreciable differences between the predicted and observed roughness values, the latter being larger on average. Significant changes in roughness may be caused by shoaling or by swell. A large increase in roughness is predicted for shoaling waves if the depth is less than about 0.2Lp. The presence of swell in the open ocean acts, on average, to significantly decrease the effective wave steepness and hence the mean roughness compared to that for a pure windsea. Thus the predicted open ocean roughness is, at most wind speeds, significantly less than is observed for pure wind waves on lakes. Only at high wind speeds, such that the windsea dominates the swell, do the mean open ocean values reach those for a fully developed sea.},

An expression for the degree of polarization is derived from the microfacet polarimetric bidirectional reflectance model for the case of scattering in the plane of incidence. Using this expression, we develop a nonlinear least-squares estimation algorithm for extracting an apparent index of refraction and the reflection angle from a set of polarization measurements collected from multiple source positions. Computer simulation results show that the estimation accuracy generally improves with an increasing number of source position measurements.

In detail however, the budget of mechanical energy input into the ocean is poorly constrained. The now inescapable conclusion that over most of the ocean significant “vertical” mixing is confined to topographically complex boundary areas implies a potentially radically different interior circulation than is possible with uniform mixing.

	abstract = {We study the polarization properties of the light field under a dynamic ocean surface using realistic linear and nonlinear ocean surface waves. The three-dimensional polarized radiative transfer of the dynamic ocean–atmosphere system is considered using a Monte Carlo vector radiative transfer simulation for arbitrary depth. The program is validated with measurement data taken in Hawaii during the Radiance in a Dynamic Ocean project. The main focus of this study is the influence of the wind-driven ocean waves on the polarization patterns and statistics at different optical depths under various conditions of light wavelength and solar incidence. Of special interest is the effect of the nonlinearity of the surface waves on the polarization statistics. To facilitate the study, phase-resolved direct simulations of the linear and nonlinear surface wavefields are performed using a high-order spectral method. The results show that the time-averaged degree of polarization within the Snell's window is dependent on the mean square slope of the ocean surface. Higher mean square slope, or wind speed, leads to a smaller degree of polarization. At the same time, the variability of the degree of polarization has a strong dependence on the surface roughness. A rougher ocean surface induces higher variability of the degree of polarization. The effect of wave nonlinearity can be neglected for the mean value of polarization, but is manifested in the variability of the degree of polarization, with a general increase in the variance with increasing wave nonlinearity. The present findings provide possible mechanisms for characterizing the dynamic ocean surface based on underwater polarized light measurements.},

The wind speed varied from near calm to 26 m s−1, and the sea-air temperature differences ranged from −15° to +7°C. The data showed that the assumption of a balance between local production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy is false and that the sign and magnitude of the imbalance depends critically on both stability and wind speed. The wide range of stability conditions allowed a new formulation for the nondimensional dissipation function under diabatic conditions. A minimum in the 10-m neutral value of the drag coefficient occurred at 6 m s−1. At lower wind speeds the data were fitted by the relationship {\textbackslash}t{\textbackslash}t{\textbackslash}t{\textbackslash}t{\textbackslash}twhere U10n. is the 10-m neutral wind speed (m s−1). At higher wind speeds {\textbackslash}t{\textbackslash}t{\textbackslash}t{\textbackslash}t{\textbackslash}twhich gives drag coefficients that are about 10\% higher than those from previous open ocean studies (which assumed a balance between production and dissipation). Wave measurement suggested that the sea state was not, on average, fully developed at wind speeds above 15 m s−1. However, contrary to findings from other studies, no large anomalies in the drag coefficient were detected despite the range of conditions and sea states encountered. It is believed that the ideal conditions (such as the absence of swell) needed to defect the effects of sea state on the wind stress may occur rather infrequently over the open ocean.},

	abstract = {This is the first part of a two-part investigation that applies nonstationary time series analysis methods and the St. Venant equations to the problem of understanding juvenile salmonid access to favorable shallow-water habitat in a tidal river. Habitat access is a function of river stage, tidal range, and the distribution of bed elevation. Part 1 models nonstationary tidal properties: species amplitudes and phases and tidal range. Part 2 models low-frequency river stage in the Lower Columbia River and reconstructs historical water levels, using the tidal model from part 1. To incorporate the nonstationary frictional effects of variable river discharge into the tidal model, we decompose the tidal wave into tidal species and calculate daily tidal range. Our one-dimensional tidal model is based on analytic wave solutions to the linearized St. Venant equation and uses six coefficients per tidal species to represent the upstream evolution of the frictionally damped tidal wave. The form of the coefficients is derived from the St. Venant equations, but their values are determined objectively from the data. About 50 station-years of surface elevation data collected (1981–2000) below Bonneville Dam (235 km from the ocean) were processed with a wavelet filter bank to retrieve time series of tidal species properties. A min-max filter was used to estimate daily tidal range. Tidal range, diurnal, and semidiurnal amplitudes were predicted with mean root mean square errors {\textless}30 mm, which is significantly more accurate than predictions obtained from harmonic analysis. Thus despite the compact form of our solution, we model nonstationary fluvial tidal properties with a high level of accuracy.},

	abstract = {The impact of air-flow separation from breaking dominant waves is analyzed. This impact results from the correlation of the pressure drop with the forward slope of breaking waves. The pressure drop is parameterized via the square of the reference mean velocity. The slope of breaking waves is related to the statistical properties of the wave breaking fronts described in terms of the average total length of breaking fronts. Assuming that the dominant waves are narrow and that the length of breaking fronts is related to the length of the contour of the breaking zone it is shown that the separation stress supported by dominant waves is proportional to the breaking probability of dominant waves. The breaking probability of dominant waves, in turn, is defined by the dominant wave steepness. With the dominant wave steepness increasing, the breaking probability is increased and so does the separation stress. This mechanism explains wave age (younger waves being steeper) and finite depth (the spectrum is steeper in shallow water) dependence of the sea drag. It is shown that dominant waves support a significant fraction of total stress (sea drag) for young seas due to the air-flow separation that occurs when they break. A good comparison of the model results for the sea drag with several data sets is reported.},

	abstract = {Parasitic ripple generation on short gravity waves (4 cm to 10 cm wavelengths) is examined using fully nonlinear computations and laboratory experiments. Time-marching simulations show sensitivity of the ripple steepness to initial conditions, in particular to the crest asymmetry. Significant crest fore–aft asymmetry and its unsteadiness enhance ripple generation at moderate wave steepness, e.g. ka between 0.15 and 0.20, a mechanism not discussed in previous studies. The maximum ripple steepness (in time) is found to increase monotonically with the underlying (low-frequency bandpass) wave steepness in our simulations. This is different from the sub- or super-critical ripple generation predicted by Longuet-Higgins (1995). Unsteadiness in the underlying gravity–capillary waves is shown to cause ripple modulation and an interesting ‘crest-shifting’ phenomenon – the gravity–capillary wave crest and the first ripple on the forward slope merge to form a new crest. Including boundary layer efects in the free-surface conditions extends some of the simulations at large wave amplitudes. However, the essential process of parasitic ripple generation is nonlinear interaction in an inviscid flow. Mechanically generated gravity–capillary waves demonstrate similar characteristic features of ripple generation and a strong correlation between ripple steepness and crest asymmetry.},

	abstract = {A simplified version of the energy balance equation is solved to obtain an expression for the ocean wave equilibrium spectrum, which is then used with a two-scale electromagnetic scattering model to calculate the radar cross section of the ocean surface. Two parameters in the energy balance equation are adjusted to minimize the difference between the calculated radar cross-section values and those given by the CMOD4 model function over a range of incidence angles and look directions, and for a series of wind speeds. The RMS difference between the CMOD4 and two-scale radar cross-section values using this model is 0.16 dB for incidence angles from 25degrees to 45degrees and wind speeds from 5 to 15 m/s. The slope variances computed from this model also agree fairly well with those measured by Cox and Munk. However, since the largest wave number influencing the C-band backscatter is approximately 200 rad/m, the spectrum is probably not valid beyond this wave number. Finally, since the spectrum is determined by the relative magnitudes of the wave growth and dissipation rates, some inferences about these parameters can be drawn. Assuming the exponential growth rate parameter to be equal to previous measurements, the dissipation rate implied by this model is more than an order of magnitude larger than that due to molecular viscosity for wind speeds greater than 7 m/s. This conclusion is consistent with observations by Jahne and Riemer, which also indicated a dissipation rate much larger than the viscous dissipation rate at high wind speeds.},

As the paddle-wave steepness is further increased, the stress level returns to the stress level characteristic of the pure wind waves. Further increase in the paddle-wave steepness augments the stress further. The WOWC model explains this peculiarity of the stress distribution by the fact that the paddle waves significantly damp the wind waves in the spectral peak. The stress supported by these dominant waves rapidly falls when the paddle wave is introduced, and this decrease is not compensated by the stress induced by the paddle wave. With further increase in the steepness of the paddle wave, the stress supported by dominant wind waves stays at a low level while the stress supported by the paddle waves continues to grow proportional to the square of the steepness, finally exceeding the stress level characteristic of the pure wind-wave field.},

EM bias, ?, the difference between the electromagnetic and true mean sea levels, was measured using Doppler scatterometers. Linear wave theory was used to relate the Doppler signal to the surface displacement, giving simultaneous coincident backscatter and wave measurements, including significant wave height, Hs. On the basis of dimensional reasoning, we suggest that the usual inhomogeneous correlations of the normalized bias b = ?/Hs with the 10 m wind speed, U10, and Hs may be improved by correlating the data with nondimensional variables, including a characteristic wave slope, s, and wave age, c/U10, where c is a characteristic phase speed of the surface waves. Using both polynomial correlations and optimal estimation techniques to fit the data, we find that the standard error of the fit is reduced by ?50\% when the dimensionless variables are used. We find that the dependence of the EM bias on the wave slope is consistent with earlier tower-based measurements and the theory of short-wave modulation by longer waves. We discuss the implications of these results for operational implementation of EM bias algorithms based on wave slope and wave age.},

Material densities ranged from 0.808 to 1.24gml-1, with about half between 0.97 and 1.04gml-1, a range not typically found in virgin plastics. Elemental analysis suggests that samples in this density range are consistent with polypropylene and polyethylene whose densities have increased, likely due to biofouling. Pelagic densities varied considerably from that of beach plastic debris, suggesting that plastic particles are modified during their residence at sea. These analyses provide clues in understanding particle fate and potential debris sources, and address ecological implications of pelagic plastic debris. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Flows in the upper ocean mixed layer are responsible for the transport and dispersion of biogeochemical tracers, phytoplankton and buoyant pollutants, such as hydrocarbons from an oil spill. Material dispersion in mixed layer flows subject to diurnal buoyancy forcing and weak winds ({\textbar}u10{\textbar}=5ms-1) are investigated using a non-hydrostatic model. Both purely buoyancy-forced and combined wind- and buoyancy-forced flows are sampled using passive tracers, as well as 2D and 3D particles to explore characteristics of horizontal and vertical dispersion. It is found that the surface tracer patterns are determined by the convergence zones created by convection cells within a time scale of just a few hours. For pure convection, the results displayed the classic signature of Rayleigh-Benard cells. When combined with a wind stress, the convective cells become anisotropic in that the along-wind length scale gets much larger than the cross-wind scale. Horizontal relative dispersion computed by sampling the flow fields using both 2D and 3D passive particles is found to be consistent with the Richardson regime. Relative dispersion is an order of magnitude higher and 2D surface releases transition to Richardson regime faster in the wind-forced case. We also show that the buoyancy-forced case results in significantly lower amplitudes of scale-dependent horizontal relative diffusivity, kD(ℓ), than those reported by Okubo (1970), while the wind- and buoyancy-forced case shows a good agreement with Okubo's diffusivity amplitude, and the scaling is consistent with Richardson's 4/3rd law, kD {\textasciitilde} ℓ4/3.

All Rights Reserved.Transport characteristics of oil slicks are reported from a controlled release experiment conducted in the North Sea in June 2015, during which mineral oil emulsions of different volumetric oil fractions and a look-alike biogenic oil were released and allowed to develop naturally. The experiment used the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) to track slick location, size, and shape for ∼8 h following release. Wind conditions during the exercise were at the high end of the range considered suitable for radar-based slick detection, but the slicks were easily detectable in all images acquired by the low noise, L-band imaging radar. The measurements are used to constrain the entrainment length and representative droplet radii for oil elements in simulations generated using the OpenOil advanced oil drift model. Simultaneously released drifters provide near-surface current estimates for the single biogenic release and one emulsion release, and are used to test model sensitivity to upper ocean currents and mixing. Results of the modeling reveal a distinct difference between the transport of the biogenic oil and the mineral oil emulsion, in particular in the vertical direction, with faster and deeper entrainment of significantly smaller droplets of the biogenic oil. The difference in depth profiles for the two types of oils is substantial, with most of the biogenic oil residing below depths of 10 m, compared to the majority of the emulsion remaining above 10 m depth.

Consequently, most studies must assume that open ocean-derived parameterizations of the air-sea momentum flux are representative of the nearshore wind forcing. Observations made at the New River Inlet in North Carolina, during the Riverine and Estuarine Transport experiment (RIVET), were used to evaluate the suitability of wind speed-dependent, wind stress parameterizations in coastal waters. As part of the field campaign, a small, agile research vessel was deployed to make high-resolution wind velocity measurements in and around the tidal inlet. The eddy covariance method was employed to recover direct estimates of the 10 m neutral atmospheric drag coefficient from the three-dimensional winds. Observations of wind stress angle, near-surface currents, and heat flux were used to analyze the cross-shore variability of wind stress steering off the mean wind azimuth. In general, for onshore winds above 5 m/s, the drag coefficient was observed to be two and a half times the predicted open ocean value. Significant wind stress steering is observed within 2 km of the inlet mouth, which is observed to be correlated with the horizontal current shear. Other mechanisms such as the reduction in wave celerity or depth-limited breaking could also play a role. It was determined that outside the influence of these typical coastal processes, the open ocean parameterizations generally represent the wind stress field. The nearshore stress variability has significant implications for observations and simulations of coastal transport, circulation, mixing, and general surf-zone dynamics.},

We suggest that when these bound waves are much shorter than the dominant waves, they are preferentially located on the leeward face of the dominant wave and hence have a mean tilt. We hypothesize that the turbulence associated with these bound waves suppresses freely propagating, wind-generated waves where bound waves are present so that we may divide the rough water surface into patches containing free and patches containing bound waves. This model is shown to account for the observed histograms of slope measured in the tank and, at least qualitatively, for the observed decrease in the probability of finding bound waves with increasing wind speed. Furthermore, if we add these bound, tilted waves to the free waves of the standard Bragg/composite-surface scattering model for microwave scattering from rough water surfaces, then the model can account for many otherwise unexplained features of the scattering. Principal among these features are the rapid decrease in polarization ratio and rapid increase in the first moment of the microwave Doppler spectrum with increasing wind speed when the antenna is directed upwind, features that occur to a much lesser extent when the antenna looks downwind.

	doi = {10.1029/2001JC000909},
	abstract = {The conventional view of microwave backscatter from the ocean is based on composite surface and quasi-specular theories. In this view, backscatter at intermediate incidence angles is due to Bragg scattering from freely propagating short surface waves that are advected and modulated by longer waves. At small incidence angles the scattering process becomes quasi-specular, coming from small facets aligned normal to the incident waves. The transition between these two processes is said to occur at incidence angles of about 10° to 20°. In this paper we demonstrate that advances in scattering theory and in computing speed make it possible to improve this view. We show that recent scattering theories agree on the form of the backscatter for incidence angles below that where multiple scattering must be considered, i.e., below about 80°. This form involves the Kirchhoff integral multiplied by a coefficient dependent on dielectric constant and incidence angle. We avoid the higher-order calculations necessary in these theories to include the variable local incidence angle caused by surface wave slopes by applying them over restricted regions of the surface. We successively break the surface into regions from which the scatter comes from small-, intermediate-, and large-scale waves. We show that in this picture, scattering from small-scale waves is classic Bragg scattering and is very common while from large-scale waves it is classic quasi-specular scattering and is rarely important. For intermediate-scale waves we evaluate the Kirchhoff integral numerically; this type of scattering becomes increasingly important with increasing wind speed. For all scales but the large one we correct the incidence angle for the slopes of all longer waves as required by composite surface theory. On this picture the transition from Bragg scattering to Kirchhoff scattering occurs gradually in a manner that is dependent on incidence angle, azimuth angle, wind speed, and the surface wave spectrum. The model indicates that Bragg scattering is often viable to surprisingly low incidence angles at low wind speeds. The model is sensitive to the wave height variance spectrum over a wide range of wave numbers. We use two recently published forms of this spectrum to compare the predictions of the model to various data that have been collected over the incidence angles range from 0° to 50°. At 0° this model produces a better fit to Ku band data from the TOPEX altimeter than does quasi-specular theory and does so with no artificial “effective reflection coefficient.” As the incidence angle increases, the model continues to show good agreement with data without an artificial division into “quasi-specular” and “Bragg” scattering. The advantage of this formulation over a quasi-specular one is demonstrated by comparing the two models with data on received power taken at 36 GHz for incidence angles between nadir and 30°.},

	title = {Deepwater {Horizon} oil spill: the fate of the oil},
	volume = {1-20},
	abstract = {The April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig led to the largest oil spill in U.S. waters. Federal government officials estimated that the deepwater well ultimately released (over 84 days) over 200 million gallons (or 4.9 million barrels) of crude oil. Although decreasing amounts of oil were observed on the ocean surface following the well's containment on July 15, 2010, oil spill response officials and researchers have found oil in other places. A pressing question that has been raised by many stakeholders is where did the oil go? On August 4, 2010, the federal government released an estimate of the oil spill budget for the Deepwater Horizon incident. On November 23, 2010, the federal government released a peer-reviewed " Technical Document " that further explained how the estimates were derived, and in some cases, modified the initial estimates. The oil budget estimates divide the released oil into seven categories, accounting for the following percentages of the total oil released. These categories generally fall into three groups: • Human intervention: direct recovery from the well (17\%); in situ burning (5\%); skimmed (3\%); chemically dispersed (16\%). • Natural Processes: naturally dispersed (13\%); evaporated or dissolved (24\%). • Other (22\%): refers to the oil remaining after subtracting the above estimates from the total estimated release; possible fates include remaining in the water column, settling to the sea floor, mixing with sediment, ingested by microbes, or collected during shore cleanup activities. Direct observation and measurement of the fate of the vast majority of the estimated 200 million gallons of oil presents a considerable challenge. In some cases, the estimates used to calculate these percentages contain considerable uncertainty. Even assuming that approximately half of the oil has been removed from the Gulf ecosystem through direct recovery, burning, skimming, or evaporation, the fate of the remaining (" other ") oil is unknown. A complete and definitive answer to the question of the remaining oil is unknown at this juncture. It is debatable whether the fate of the remaining oil will ever be established conclusively, because multiple challenges hinder this objective: the complexity of the Gulf system; resources required to collect data; and varied interpretations over the results and observations. Moreover, as time progresses, determining the fate of the oil will likely become more difficult. Regardless, the question of oil fate will likely be answered through an incremental process. Researchers are continuing to study various components of the Gulf, specifically damages to natural resources. Some of these efforts may provide clues to the oil's fate. Because evaluating the actual fate of the oil may take time and may prove difficult, perceptions of the oil's fate may influence congressional interest and action, with consequences for the affected stakeholders. The perception of the spill's fate may be influenced by multiple factors, including oil spill assessments, the group that prepared the assessment, and the manner in which the assessment is presented. If policymakers have the perception that the oil has degraded with minimal impacts to the environment, attention to the oil spill's consequences and associated impacts may wane. On the other hand, a perception that a substantial volume of oil remains and poses a threat to the environment could result in continuing pressure on Gulf industries and livelihoods.},

	issn = {21699291},
	doi = {10.1029/2005JC003004},
	abstract = {Waves have many effects on near-surface dynamics: Breaking waves enhance mixing, waves are associated with a Lagrangian mean drift (the Stokes drift), waves act on the mean flow by creating Langmuir circulations and a return flow opposite to the Stokes drift, and, last but not least, waves modify the atmospheric surface roughness. A realistic ocean model is proposed to embrace all these aspects, focusing on near-surface mixing and surface drift associated with the wind and generated waves. The model is based on the generalized Lagrangian mean that separates the momentum into a wave pseudomomentum and a quasi-Eulerian momentum. A wave spectrum with a reasonably high frequency range is used to compute the Stokes drift. A turbulent closure scheme based on a single evolution equation for the turbulent kinetic energy includes the mixing due to breaking wave effects and wave-turbulence interactions. The roughness length of the closure scheme is adjusted using observations of turbulent kinetic energy near the surface. The model is applied to unstratified and horizontally uniform conditions, showing good agreement with observations of strongly mixed quasi-Eulerian currents near the surface when waves are developed. Model results suggest that a strong surface shear persists in the drift current because of the Stokes drift contribution. In the present model the surface drift only reaches 1.5\% of the wind speed. It is argued that stratification and the properties of drifting objects may lead to a supplementary drift as large as 1\% of the wind speed. Citation:},

While the interior part of the Ekman layer has been extensively studied using drogued drifters, the drift at—or very close to—the surface is less investigated. The wind response of surface currents on time scales from 1 h to 10 days is analyzed using two types of satellite-tracked drifters: (i) spherical floats on the surface and (ii) drifters with a drogue centered at 70 cm depth. The response of drifting objects to wind and wave forcing is highly dependent on the vertical position, even within the upper meter of the ocean. The surface drifters are wind coherent for both cyclonic and anticyclonic subinertial frequencies. In contrast, the subsurface drift responds primarily to anticyclonic forcing that resonates with the intrinsic ocean dynamics.},

	abstract = {In an effort to measure current shear very near the sea surface a string of vector-measuring current meters suspended beneath a surface float was deployed 180 km off southern California at 34°N 121°30′W on November 26, 1981 and allowed to drift freely for over 6 days. This arrangement, which we call the current meter drifter (CMD), gave measurements at depths of 2.5, 5.5, 8.5, 11.5, 14.5, 25, and 63 m. During the first two days, when the winds were light (≃8 m/s) and variable in direction, a nearly uniform current shear was observed in the upper 15 m with a low-frequency velocity difference of 5 cm/s between the instruments at 2.5 and 14.5 m. During the last four days, when the winds were brisk ({\textgreater} 12 m/s) and steady in direction from the NNW, a strong downwind shear of order 10−2 s−1 was observed in the upper 10 m with a velocity difference of ∼7 cm/s between the instruments at 2.5 and 8.5 m. During this same period the shear below 10 m was much smaller. The average currents during the CMD drift veer to the right of the wind stress with angular displacement increasing with depth. Time series of the velocity difference between 2.5 and 5.5 m compare very well with θ(t)u * K −1 In (5.5/2.5), where θ(t) is the wind direction vector (of unit magnitude), u * = (wind stress/ρ)½ is the friction velocity in water, and K = 0.4 is von Karman's constant. On the other hand, a similar comparison of the velocity difference between 5.5 and 8.5 m to θ(t)u * K −1In (8.5/5.5) is much poorer with observed velocity difference being much larger, possibly due to stable stratification effects. Possible errors in the measurements have been considered and estimated as less than the observed velocity differences. Near-surface shears as large as the observed are very important in closing the momentum budget for the oceanic boundary layer.},

	abstract = {A model that describes the impact of swell on the marine atmospheric boundary layer is proposed. The model is based on the two-layer approximation of the boundary layer: the near-surface inner region and the outer region above. The swell-induced momentum and energy fluxes are confined within the inner region. Swell loses energy to the atmosphere and enhances the turbulent kinetic energy in the inner region. The transfer of momentum results in acceleration or deceleration of the airflow near the surface. Following-wind swell accelerates the flow, which for a very low wind results in a swell-driven wind. Opposite-wind swell decelerates the airflow, which for a steep swell could cause the reverse airflow. The sea drag in the case of opposite-wind swell is considerably enhanced as compared with the following-wind swell case. Cross-wind swell causes the rotation of the wind velocity vector with height, which leads to the deviation of the turbulent stress vector from the wind velocity vector. The impact of swell becomes more pronounced when the wind speed decreases or when the swell phase velocity increases. In fact, it is the wave age of the swell that characterizes the swell impact because the dimensionless wave-induced fluxes of energy and momentum are proportional to the wave age parameter. Both fluxes are also proportional to the swell slope so that the swell impact is stronger for a steeper swell. The model reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the main experimental findings for the ocean swell: the impact of swell on the sea drag is very pronounced for opposite-wind swell, is less pronounced for cross-wind swell, and is only at low wind speeds.},

Direct observa-tions from an ultrasonic anemometer and vertical array of ADVs show that the magnitude and direction of stress changed across the air–sea interface, suggesting that a stress divergence occurred at or near the water surface. Using a numerical wave model in combination with direct flux measurements, the air–sea momentum flux was partitioned between the surface wave field and the mean flow. Results indicate that the surface wave field can store or release a significant fraction of the total momentum flux depending on the direction of the wind. When wind blew across dominant fetch axes, the generation of short gravity waves stored as much as 40\% of the total wind stress. Accounting for the storage of momentum in the surface wave field closed the air–sea momentum budget. Agreement between the direction of Lagrangian shear and the direction of the stress vector in the mixed surface layer suggests that the observed directional difference was due to the combined effect of breaking waves producing downward sweeps of momentum in the direction of wave propagation and the straining of that vor-ticity field in a manner similar to Langmuir turbulence.},

As in previous studies, the dissipation rate of TKE is found to be higher in the wavy ocean surface boundary layer than it would be in a flow past a rigid boundary with similar stress and buoyancy forcing. Estimates of the terms in the turbulent kinetic energy equation indicate that, unlike in a flow past a rigid boundary, the dissipation rates cannot be balanced by local production terms, suggesting that the transport of TKE is important in the ocean surface boundary layer. A simple analytic model containing parameterizations of production, dissipation, and transport reproduces key features of the vertical profile of TKE, including enhancement near the surface. The effective turbulent diffusion coefficient for heat is larger than would be expected in a rigid-boundary boundary layer. This diffusion coefficient is predicted reasonably well by a model that contains the effects of shear production, buoyancy forcing, and transport of TKE (thought to be related to wave breaking). Neglect of buoyancy forcing or wave breaking in the parameterization results in poor predictions of turbulent diffusivity. Langmuir turbulence was detected concurrently with a fraction of the turbulence quantities reported here, but these times did not stand out as having significant differences from observations when Langmuir turbulence was not detected.},

	abstract = {[1] Accurate evaluation of the hydrodynamic modulation of short wind waves by dominant gravity waves is needed for various applications of microwave radar remote sensing of the ocean surface. Such knowledge is also essential for the studies of wind wave coupling and air-sea momentum/energy transfer. Here, we present direct field observations of the hydrodynamic modulation transfer function (MTF) during two field programs (High-Resolution Remote Sensing Experiment (High-Res) off Cape Hatteras, June 1993, and Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) experiment off the California coast, April and May 1995). Gravity-capillary wave spectra were obtained using a scanning laser slope gauge (SLSG) for wave numbers between 25 and 800 rad m(-1). An array of capacitive wave wires and a motion detection package were used for the measurement of surface gravity waves. These instruments were mounted on a research catamaran, which was towed to the side of a research vessel. The observations were mostly made under low wind conditions. The observed coherence is mostly below 0.1, suggesting that the modulation of short wind waves is not strongly correlated with dominant gravity waves. The coherence is slightly higher for wave numbers 50-100 rad m(-1) than for wave numbers above 200 rad m(-1). When wind and dominant waves are aligned and the water surface is clean, the magnitude of the hydrodynamic MTF is around 2-4 and its phase is close to 0. When surfactants are present and short wind wave spectra are reduced, the MTF magnitudes become significantly larger for wave numbers above 200 rad m(-1). When wind and dominant waves are not aligned, the coherence becomes lower as expected. The results from the two field experiments are roughly consistent with each other. The existing relaxation model may predict the hydrodynamic MTF values that are roughly consistent with the observations if the effect of modulated wind stress over gravity waves is included.},

	abstract = {Nearly all of the momentum transferred from wind to waves comes about through wave-induced pressure acting on the slopes of waves: known as form drag. Direct field measurements of the wave-induced pressure in airflow over water waves are difficult and consequently rare. Those that have been reported are for deep water conditions and conditions in which the level of forcing, measured by the ratio of wind speed to the speed of the dominant (spectral peak) waves, is quite weak, U10/cp 3. The data reported here were obtained over a large shallow lake during the Australian Shallow Water Experiment (AUSWEX). The propagation speeds of the dominant waves were limited by depth and the waves were correspondingly steep. This wider range of forcing and concomitant wave steepness revealed some new aspects of the rate of wave amplification by wind, the so-called wind input source function, in the energy balance equation for winddriven water waves. It was found that the exponential growth rate parameter (fractional energy increase per radian) depended on the slope of the waves, ak, vanishing as ak → 0. For very strong forcing a condition of “full separation” occurs, where the airflow detaches from the crests and reattaches on the windward face leaving a separation zone over the leeward face and the troughs. In a sense, the outer flow does not “see” the troughs and the resulting wave-induced pressure perturbation is much reduced, leading to a reduction in the wind input source function relative to that obtained by extrapolation from more benign conditions. The source function parameterized on wave steepness and degree of separation is shown to be in agreement with previous field and laboratory data obtained in conditions of much weaker forcing and wave steepness. The strongly forced steady-state conditions of AUSWEX have enabled the authors to define a generalized wind input source function that is suitable for a wide range of conditions.},

	abstract = {Measurements in a closed, recirculating wind-wave tank using variable wind speeds showed that wind waves in the gravity-capillary range exhibit a threshold in their growth. Surface wave height variance spectral densities in the wave number domain were measured for gravity-capillary waves using both radar backscatter and a wavelet transform technique applied to a laser probe. The measurements showed that when the wind speed was slowly ramped up, a threshold wind speed or friction velocity was required to produce waves. Turning the wind on suddenly showed that the wind stress did not grow as rapidly as the wind since the surface waves supporting the stress grew relatively slowly. Changing water temperature or current in the water caused a pronounced change in the wind speed threshold but not in the friction velocity threshold. Changes in fetch of as much as a factor of 2 had no discernible effect on the thresholds. The results imply that wind speed, being a condition imposed on the air-water interface, causes wave growth, while friction velocity, being a result of air-water interactions, is closely related to surface roughness, hence radar cross section, and changes during wave growth.},

The first part examines the influence of equilibrium wind-waves on vertical tracer distributions, based on large eddy simulations (LESs) of the wave-averaged Navier-Stokes equation. Motivated by observations of buoyant microplastic marine debris (MPMD), this study applies the LES model and the parametric one-dimensional column model from part one to examine the vertical distributions of MPMD. MPMD is widely distributed in vast regions of the subtropical gyres and has emerged as a major open ocean pollutant whose distribution is subject to upper ocean turbulence. The models capture shear-driven turbulence, Langmuir turbulence (LT), and enhanced turbulent kinetic energy input due to breaking waves (BWs). Model results are only consistent with observations of MPMD profiles and the relationship between surface concentrations and wind speed if LT effects are included. Neither BW nor shear-driven turbulence is capable of deeply submerging MPMD, suggesting that the observed vertical MPMD distributions are a characteristic signature of wave-driven LT. Thus, this study demonstrates that LT substantially increases turbulent transport in the OSBL, resulting in deep submergence of buoyant tracers. The parametric model is applied to 11 years of observations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific subtropical gyres to show that surface measurements substantially underestimate MPMD concentrations by a factor of 3-13. Key Points: Langmuir turbulence deeply submerges microplastic marine debris Microplastic marine debris content is underestimated by surface measurements Sea state and rise velocity are key parameters for marine debris distributions.},

This hypothesis has been widely invoked to compute Reynolds averaging using temporal turbulence data measured at a single point in space. However, in the atmospheric surface layer, the exact relationship between convection velocity and wave number k has not been fully revealed since previous observations were limited by either their spatial resolution or by the sampling length. Using Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS), acquiring turbulent temperature fluctuations at high temporal and spatial frequencies, we computed convection velocities across wave numbers using a phase spectrum method. We found that convection velocity decreases as k−1/3 at the higher wave numbers of the inertial subrange instead of being independent of wave number as suggested by Taylor's hypothesis. We further corroborated this result using large eddy simulations. Applying Taylor's hypothesis thus systematically underestimates turbulent spectrum in the inertial subrange. A correction is proposed for point-based eddy-covariance measurements, which can improve surface energy budget closure and estimates of CO2 fluxes.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n},

In this paper we present the results of an experimental determination of the wavenumber spectrum for the wavelength range of 0.2-1.6 m, based on stereo- photogrammetric determinations from an oil platform under open ocean conditions. From our observations, for this wavenumber range, the one-dimensional equilibrium wavenumber spectrum was determined as (FORMULA) respectively, with B and A 0.3 x lop4 for (u: kJg) = and k = Ikl is expressed in cycles/metre. The present findings do not support the wavenumber dependence predicted by the recent models in this wavenumber range and are at variance with their predicted dependence on the friction velocity. However, our observations are generally consistent with the radar reflectivity dependence on wind direction and wind speed under Bragg scattering conditions within our wavenumber range. The experimental observations also point out the potentially important role of wave-breaking of longer wave components in influencing the spectral levels of short gravity wave components.},

Recent field data showed that parametrization using the mean square slope of small scale surface waves provides a more robust strategy to estimate gas transfer (Frew et al. 2004). Here we present a preliminary estimation of the gas transfer velocity as a function of upwind Normalized Radar Cross-Section (NRCS) as measured by the scatterometer QuikSCAT. The gas transfer velocity calculated from upwind NRCS exhibits a quadratic-like dependence at low and intermediate wind speeds (≃6 ms-1).

	abstract = {In this work, the benefits of high-frequency (HF) radar ocean observation technology for backtracking drift- ing objects are analysed. The HF radar performance is evaluated by comparison of trajectories between drifter buoys versus numerical simulations using a Lagrangian trajectory model. High-resolution currents measured by a coastal HF radar network combined with atmospheric fields provided by numerical models are used to backtrack the trajectory of two dataset of surface-drifting buoys: group I (with drogue) and group II (without drogue). A methodolo- gy based on optimization methods is applied to estimate the uncertainty in the trajectory simulations and to optimize the search area of the backtracked positions. The results show that, to backtrack the trajectory of the buoys in group II, both currents and wind fields were required. However, wind fields could be practically discarded when simulating the trajectories of group I. In this case, the optimal backtracked trajectories were obtained using only HF radar currents as forcing. Based on the radar availability data, two periods ranging between 8 and 10 h were selected to backtrack the buoy trajectories. The root mean squared error (RMSE) was found to be 1.01 km for group I and 0.82 km for group II. Taking into account these values, a search area was calcu- lated using circles of RMSE radii, obtaining 3.2 and 2.11 km2 for groups I and II, respectively. These results show the positive contribution of HF radar currents for backtracking drifting objects and demonstrate that these data combined with atmospheric models are of value to perform backtracking analysis of drifting objects.},

	abstract = {TRANSFER of momentum from wind to the surface layer of lakes and oceans plays a central part in driving horizontal and vertical circulation of water masses. Much work has been devoted to understanding the role of waves in momentum transfer across the air–sea interface, but less is known about the energetics of the near-surface turbulence responsible for the mixing of momentum and mass into the underlying water column. In particular, it has remained unclear whether the structure of the turbulence in the surface layer can be described by analogy to wall-bounded shear flows or whether waves, either through breaking or wave–current interaction, introduce new length- and timescales which must be modelled explicitly. Here we report observations of turbulence in Lake Ontario, taken under conditions of strong wave breaking, which reveal a greatly enhanced dissipation rate of kinetic energy close to the air–water interface, relative to the predictions of wall-layer theory. Because wave breaking is intermittent, short-term measurements of the kinetic energy dissipation in the near-surface layer may therefore result in considerable underestimates, and any general treatment of upper mixed layer dynamics will have to take wave breaking explicitly into account.},

	doi = {10.1029/2004JD005462},
	abstract = {The goal of this study is to quantify the world’s wind power potential for the first time from data. Wind speeds are calculated at 80 m, the hub height of modern, 77-m diameter, 1500 kW turbines. Since relatively few observations are available at 80 m, the Least Square extrapolation technique is utilized and revised here to obtain estimates of wind speeds at 80 m given observed wind speeds at 10 m (widely available) and a network of sounding stations. Tower data from the Kennedy Space Center (Florida) were used to validate the results. Globally, {\textasciitilde}13\% of all reporting stations experience annual mean wind speeds {\textgreater}=6.9 m/s at 80 m (i.e., wind power class 3 or greater) and can therefore be considered suitable for low-cost wind power generation. This estimate is believed to be conservative. Of all continents, North America has the largest number of stations in class {\textgreater}= 3 (453), and Antarctica has the largest percent (60\%). Areas with great potential are found in northern Europe along the North Sea, the southern tip of the South American continent, the island of Tasmania in Australia, the Great Lakes region, and the northeastern and northwestern coasts of North America. The global average 10-m wind speed over the ocean from measurements is 6.64 m/s (class 6); that over land is 3.28 m/s (class 1). The calculated 80-m values are 8.60 m/s (class 6) and 4.54 m/s (class 1) over ocean and land, respectively. Over land, daytime 80-m wind speed averages obtained from soundings (4.96 m/s) are slightly larger than nighttime ones (4.85 m/s); nighttime wind speeds increase, on average, above daytime speeds above 120 m. Assuming that statistics generated from all stations analyzed here are representative of the global distribution of winds, global wind power generated at locations with mean annual wind speeds {\textgreater}=6.9 m/s at 80 m is found to be {\textasciitilde}72 TW ({\textasciitilde}54,000 Mtoe) for the year 2000. Even if only {\textasciitilde}20\% of this power could be captured, it could satisfy 100\% of the world’s energy demand for all purposes (6995–10177 Mtoe) and over seven times the world’s electricity needs (1.6–1.8 TW). Several practical barriers need to be overcome to fully realize this potential.},

Our framework can be applied to derive a range ofmeaningful surface reconstructions from this high dimensional space. The key observation is that the range of solutions is related to the degree of anisotropy in applying weights to the gradients in the inte- gration process.While common approaches use isotropic weights, we show that by using a progression of spatially varying anisotropic weights, we can achieve significant improvement in reconstructions.We propose (a) α-surfaces using binary weights,where the parameter α allows trade off between smoothness and ro- bustness, (b) M-estimators and edge preserving regularization using continuous weights and (c) Diffusion using affine transformation of gradients. We provide results on photometric stereo, compare with previous approaches and show that anisotropic treatment discounts noise while recovering salient features in recon- structions.},

Here we show that current parameterizations of this turbulent mixing lead to systematic and substantial errors in the depth of the OSBL in global climate models, which then leads to biases in sea surface temperature. One reason, we argue, is that current parameterizations are missing key surface-wave processes that force Langmuir turbulence that deepens the OSBL more rapidly than steady wind forcing. Scaling arguments are presented to identify two dimensionless parameters that measure the importance of wave forcing against wind forcing, and against buoyancy forcing. A global perspective on the occurrence of wave-forced turbulence is developed using re-analysis data to compute these parameters globally. The diagnostic study developed here suggests that turbulent energy available for mixing the OSBL is under-estimated without forcing by surface waves. Wave-forcing and hence Langmuir turbulence could be important over wide areas of the ocean and in all seasons in the Southern Ocean. We conclude that surface-wave-forced Langmuir turbulence is an important process in the OSBL that requires parameterization.},

The LAWAS measured wave slope spectra were consistent with local wind speeds and QuikSCAT measured NRCS. Our measured short wave mean slopes indicate their enhancement by long waves (0–1 rad m−1) at small values of long-wave slope. Concurrent with wave slope measurements, the strength of the reflected LAWAS light beam was analyzed in terms of the light attenuation coefficient at 900 nm. We have observed a correlation between surface elevation and light attenuation. The mechanism of wave modulated beam attenuation was found to be related to the instantaneous long wave skewness.},

	abstract = {Dispersed oils (i.e., oil droplets) at sea are transported by convection due to waves and buoyancy and by turbulent diffusion. This work follows the common approach in the oil community of using a Lagrangian approach instead of the Eulerian approach. Our focus was on small scale simulation of oil plumes subjected to regular waves. Stokes' theory was used to obtain analytical expressions for wave kinematics. The velocity above the Mean Water Level was obtained using a second order Taylor's expansion of the velocity at the MWL. Five hundred droplets were used to simulate the plume for a duration of 60 wave periods. A Monte Carlo framework (300 simulations) was used to compute theoretical mean and variance of plumes. In addition, we introduced a novel dimensionless formulation, whose main advantage was to allow one to report distances in terms of the wave length and times in terms of the wave period. We found that the Stokes' drift was the major mechanism for horizontal transport. We also found that lighter oils propagate faster but spread less than heavier oils. Increasing turbulent diffusion caused the plume to disperse deeper in the water column and to propagate less forward. The spreading in both vertical and horizontal directions increased with an increase in turbulent diffusion. The increase in wave slope (or wave steepness) caused, in general, an increase in the downward and horizontal transport. In the context of mixing in the water column, the dimensionless formulation showed that small steepness waves with a large turbulent diffusion coefficient could result in essentially the same spreading as large steepness waves with a small turbulent diffusion coefficient. ?? 2006.},

	abstract = {A method is developed for interpreting the statistics of the suns glitter on the sea surface in terms of the statistics of the slope distribution. The method consists of two principal phases: (1) of identifying, from geometric considerations, any point on the surface with the particular slope required for the reflection of the suns rays toward the observer; and (2) of interpreting the average brightness of the sea surface in the vicinity of this point in terms of the frequency with which this particular slope occurs. The computation of the probability of large (and infrequent) slopes is limited by the disappearance of the glitter into a background consisting of (1) the sunlight scattered from particles beneath the sea surface, and (2) the skylight reflected by the sea surface.The method has been applied to aerial photographs taken under carefully chosen conditions in the Hawaiian area. Winds were measured from a vessel at the time and place of the aerial photographs, and cover a range from 1 to 14 m sec-1. The effect of surface slicks, laid by the vessel, are included in the study. A two-dimensional Gram-Charlier series is fitted to the data. As a first approximation the distribution is Gaussian and isotropic with respect to direction. The mean square slope (regardless of direction) increases linearly with the wind speed, reaching a value of (tan 16)2 for a wind speed of 14 m sec-1. The ratio of the up/downwind to the crosswind component of mean square slope varies from 1.0 to 1.9. There is some up/downwind skewness which increases with increasing wind speed. As a result the most probable slope at high winds is not zero but a few degrees, with the azimuth of ascent pointing downwind. The measured peakedness which is barely above the limit of observational error, is such as to make the probability of very large and very small slopes greater than Gaussian. The effect of oil slicks covering an area of one-quarter square mile is to reduce the mean square slopes by a factor of two or three, to eliminate skewness, but to leave peakedness unchanged.},

Asymptotic matching of the velocity distributions in inner and outer portions of the mixed layer yields a slip law of logarithmic form, akin to the drag law of a turbulent boundary layer. The dominant independent variable is the ratio of water-side roughness length to mixed layer depth or turbulent Ekman depth. Convection due to surface cooling is also an important influence, reducing surface slip. Water-side roughness length is a wind-wave property, varying with wind speed similarly to air-side roughness. Slip velocity is typically 20 times water-side friction velocity or 3\% of wind speed, varying within a range of about 2 to 4.5\%. A linearized model of turbulent kinetic energy distribution shows much higher values near the surface than in a wall layer.

This paper describes the formalism and the conceptual assumptions of a Lagrangian marine surface oil slick numerical model and rewrites the constitutive equations in a modern mathematical framework. The Lagrangian numerical representation of the oil slick requires three different state variables: the slick, the particle and the structural state variables. Transformation processes (evaporation, spreading, dispersion and coastal adhesion) act on the slick state variables, while particle variables are used to model the transport and diffusion processes. The slick and particle variables are recombined together to compute the oil concentration in water, a structural state variable. The mathematical and numerical formulation of oil transport, diffusion and transformation processes described in this paper, together with the many simplifying hypothesis and parameterizations, form the basis of a new, open source Lagrangian surface oil spill model, the so-called MEDSLIK-II, based on its precursor MEDSLIK (Lardner et al., 1998, 2006; Zodiatis et al., 2008a).

The effects of surface roughness on the radiation field in the atmosphere and ocean are studied and compared with satellite and surface measurements. The results show that ocean surface roughness has significant effects on the upwelling radiation in the atmosphere and the downwelling radiation in the ocean. As wind speed increases, the angular domain of sunglint broadens, the surface albedo decreases, and the transmission to the ocean increases. The downward radiance field in the upper ocean is highly anisotropic, but this anisotropy decreases rapidly as surface wind increases and as ocean depth increases. The effects of surface roughness on radiation also depend greatly on both wavelength and angle of incidence (i.e., solar elevation); these effects are significantly smaller throughout the spectrum at high Sun.

	volume = {55},
	issn = {00222402},
	abstract = {Bubble populations and gas transfer velocities were measured in cleaned and surfactant-influenced freshwater and seawater. A nonlinear fitting technique was used to partition the total gas transfer velocity for a gas in each water type into a turbulence- and bubble-mediated fraction. This showed that the bubble-mediated transfer fraction was larger in cleaned freshwater than in cleaned seawater and that the difference was a function of diffusivity and solubility. This was explained by the fact that the bubble measurements showed that bubble plumes in cleaned freshwater had a higher concentration of large bubbles and a lower concentration of small bubbles than the plumes in cleaned seawater. The differences between the behavior of the bubble-mediated gas flux in cleaned freshwater and cleaned seawater show that caution should be used when intercomparing laboratory results from measurements made in different media. These differences also will make parameterizations of bubble-mediated gas exchange developed using freshwater laboratory data difficult to apply directly to oceanic conditions. It was found that adding a surfactant to seawater had minimal impact on the concentration of bubbles in the plumes. Because surfactants decrease the gas flux to the individual bubbles, the similarity in bubble population meant that the addition of surfactant to seawater decreased the bubble-mediated gas flux compared to the flux in cleaned seawater. In contrast, the addition of a surfactant to freshwater increased the concentration of bubbles by over an order of magnitude. This increase in bubble population was large enough to offset the decrease in the flux to the individual bubbles so that the net bubble-mediated gas flux in freshwater increased when surfactant was added. This difference in behavior of the bubble population and bubble-mediated transfer velocity between surfactant-influenced and cleaned waters further complicates interrelating laboratory measurements and applying laboratory results to the ocean.},

	abstract = {Air-sea interaction data from a situation with pronounced unidirectional swell have been analyzed. Measurements of turbulence at three levels (10, 18, and 26 m above mean sea level) together with directional wave buoy data from the site Ostergarnsholm in the Baltic Sea were used. The situation, which lasted for similar to 48 hours, appeared in the aftermath of a gale. The wind direction during the swell situation turned slowly within a 90 degrees sector. Both during the gale phase and the swell phase the over-water fetch was: {\textgreater}150 km. The wind speed during the swell phase was typically 4 m s(-1). During the swell phase a wind maximum near or below the lowest wind speed measuring level 10 m was observed. The net momentum flux was very small, resulting in C-D values similar to 0.7 x 10(-3). Throughout the lowest 26 m, covered by the tower measurements, turbulence intensities in all three components remained high despite the low value of the kinematic momentum flux {\textless}(-u'w')over bar{\textgreater}, resulting in a reduction of the correlation coefficient for thr longitudinal and vertical velocity from its typical value around -0.35 to between -0.2 and 0 (and with some positive values at the higher measuring levels), appearing abruptly at wave age c(0)/U-10 equal to 1.2. Turbulence spectra of the horizontal components were shown not to scale with height above the water surface, in contrast to vertical velocity spectra for which such a variation was observed in the low-frequency range. In addition, spectral peaks in the horizontal wind spectra were found at a frequency as low as 10(-3) Hz. From a comparison with results from a previous study it was concluded that this turbulence is of the "inactive" kind, being brought down from the upper parts of the boundary layer by pressure transport.},

High winds generate large amounts of sea spray, which can modify the transfer of momentum, heat, and moisture across the air-sea interface. However, the extent to which sea spray can modify extratropical or midlatitude hurricanes and intense cyclones has not been resolved. This paper reports simulations of extratropical Hurricanes Earl (1998) and Danielle (1998) and an intense winter cyclone from January 2000 using a mesoscale atmospheric model and a recent sea spray parameterization. These simulations show that sea spray can increase the sea surface heat flux, especially the latent heat flux, in a midlatitude cyclone and that sea spray's impact on cyclone intensity depends on the storm structure and development and is strongest for cyclones with high winds.},

Numerical and experimental results of the bridge piers on the tidal flows in the Yangtze estuary were presented by the use of the shallow water equations and physical model of the Yangtze estuary. The local structures of the complicated turbulent flows around a bottom-mounted pier and the resultant local scouring are the second issue which reserves much attention in scientific research. Based on the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the k-omega turbulence model, numerical results of the turbulent flows around the single pile and grouping piles were studied numerically. The third issue is the hydrodynamic loads on the piled slab pier of the sea-crossing bridges in the action of irregular wave-current combination. Based on the experimental results of the wave-current loads on each pile of the grouping piles and the slab of the Donghai bridge, the effects of grouping piles were discussed. ?? 2006 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.},

	doi = {10.1029/JC087iC03p01961},
	abstract = {Recently published data taken in wind-wave tanks and on the ocean are shown to yield a growth rate, β, describing the transfer of energy and momentum directly from wind to surface waves, that is well described by the relation β = [(0.04±0.02)u*2ω cos θ]/c2 over a wide range of frequencies. Here u* is air friction velocity, ω is radian wave frequency, c is phase speed, and θ is the angle between wind and waves. Using this form and the requirement that the momentum flux from wind to waves not exceed the wind stress, we show that the total mean-square, upwind/downwind wave slope between the frequencies g/2πU10 and 20 Hz must be less than ρa/[ρω(0.04±0.02)], where ρa and ρω are air and water densities, g is gravitational acceleration, and U10 is wind speed at 10 m. Measurements of mean square slope both in wavetanks and on the ocean seem to show agreement with this limitation as long as the air-water interface is well defined. One implication of such a slope limitation is that mean slope spectral densities are limited to values which decrease as the peak frequency of a wind wave spectrum decreases. This may provide an explanation for the observation that mean-square, dominant wave slopes are typically smaller on the ocean than in wavetanks.},

Drag coefficients from 196 Reynolds flux measurements agree well with those reported in Smith (1980) based on independent observations at the same site. Based on 192 runs, a comparison of the dissipation and Reynolds flux results shows excellent agreement on average, for wind speeds from 4 to 20 m s−1. The much more extensive dissipation data set (1086 h from the tower and 505 h from the weathership PAPA, CCGS Quadra) was used to investigate the dependence of the drag coefficient on wind speed, fetch and stability. The drag coefficient reduced to 10 m height and neutral conditions (CDN), is independent of stability and fetch (for fetch/height 800) but increases with wind speed above 10 m s−1. Some time series of the momentum flux and drag coefficient are shown to demonstrate additional sources of variation in the drag coefficient. CDN is observed to be smaller, on average. during rising winds than during failing winds or after a change in wind direction. Based on our results and many deep water results of others, we obtainwhere U10 is the wind speed at a height of 10 m.

	abstract = {Two continuous wave microwave systems were mounted on an elevator on the German Forschungsplattform Nordsee (FPN) during the Synthetic Aperture and X Band Ocean Nonlinearities (SAXON)-FPN experiment. Here we report on measurements of long-wave effects in the power received by these systems and in the Doppler bandwidths recorded from the systems. the two systems operated at X and Ka Bands (10 and 35 GHz) and collected HH- and VV-polarized backscatter signals simultaneously. The elevator system allowed us to vary the altitude of the microwave antennas above the sea surface from 7.5 to 27 m, always in the far field of the antennas. Most data were collected at a 45° incidence angle, which implied that the Ka band system illuminated areas from 0.4 to 6.0 m2 while the X band system viewed spots between 2.9 and 41.3 m2. We have attempted to characterize the modulation of both received power and Doppler bandwidth in terms of the standard modulation transfer function (MTF) concept. We find that our measurements of the MTF for received power agree well with previous measurements at X band but that the phase of the MTF for VV polarization is different from that previously reported for Ka band at a 60° incidence angle. We show how the amplitude and phase of the MTF as well as the coherence function vary with wind speed, long-wave frequency, long-wave propagation direction, and antenna height. In the case of the first three parameters our results agree with previous work except as noted above for Ka band. The dependence of the MTF on antenna height has not been investigated previously. Our results show that this dependence is small and well explained by the height variations induced as long waves propagate through the footprint on the surface. When we apply the MTF concept to the Doppler bandwidth, we find that the MTF of the bandwidth is small except at very low wind speeds. In view of the association of this bandwidth with velocities of subresolution-scale, or intermediate-scale, waves which are themselves modulated by the long waves, we find these small MTFs associated with Doppler bandwidths to be somewhat surprising. We present a simple model to attempt to draw inferences about the amplitude modulation of intermediate-scale waves from our results. We also conclude from the small MTFs for Doppler bandwidths that the assumption of a constant correlation time in theories of synthetic aperture radar imagery of the ocean is well justified.},

	abstract = {The principle of conservation of action is applied to derive a spectral form for short, wind-generated waves on the ocean which is valid to second order in the slopes of longer surface waves. Using this form, composite surface theory is applied to microwave backscatter from the ocean surface in the Bragg regime to derive an expression for the normalized radar cross section of the sea, σ0, which is also valid to second order in long-wave slope. This expression is compared with previous data and empirical models of σ0 and is shown to account for the observed incidence angle, azimuth angle, wind speed, and polarization dependence. Comparisons are made at Ku and C band for incidence angles between 20° and 70°. The theory indicates the manner in which atmospheric stability, long-wave spectra, and sea surface temperature may influence σ0. Upwind-downwind asymmetry of σ0 is shown to occur because of the second-order interaction of short-wave modulation with the orbital velocities of long waves. Furthermore, the results suggest that the wind speed dependence of σ0 varies only slightly with microwave frequency, while the magnitude of σ0 increases somewhat with frequency until viscous or turbulent dissipation reduces short-wave growth rates and thus amplitudes. Implications for scatterometer algorithm development are discussed.},

In order to investigate the depth profile and physical properties of buoyant plastic debris, we used a new type of multi-level trawl at 12 sites within the North Atlantic sub-tropical gyre to sample from the air–seawater interface to a depth of 5 m, at 0.5 m intervals. Our results show that plastic concentrations drop exponentially with water depth, and de-cay rates decrease with increasing Beaufort number. Further-more, smaller pieces presented lower rise velocities and were more susceptible to vertical transport. This resulted in higher depth decays of plastic mass concentration (milligrams m −3) than numerical concentration (pieces m −3). Further multi-level sampling of plastics will improve our ability to predict at-sea plastic load, size distribution, drifting pattern, and im-pact on marine species and habitats.},

Traditional methods of enterococci analyses are time consuming, resulting in delays in issuing beach closures. Models can potentially circumvent these delays by forecasting times when beaches should be closed. The objective of this study is to develop an innovative coupled microbehydrodynamic- morphological model. The unique feature of this model is its capability of simulating the release of microbes attached to coastal beach sands as a result of combined wave and tidal forcing. A nearshore process model (XBeach) was coupled with a microbe transport-decay equation. This equation included source functions that accounted for microbial release from mobilized sand, groundwater flow, entrainment through pore water diffusion, rainfall-runoff loading, and a fate function that accounted for solar inactivation effects. The model successfully simulated observed spatial and temporal patterns of enterococci in the beach water, including the reproduction of diel and tidal fluctuations and the rapid decrease of enterococci levels from the waterline to offshore. Primary processes for enterococci loading to the water column included wave-induced sediment resuspension and tidal washing for the entrainment of enterococci from the pore water in the intertidal zone. Diffusion was the major mechanism to transport enterococci from the intertidal zone to offshore. Sunlight inactivation was a key process to reduce enterococci levels during the day and to produce the diurnal cycles. Rainfall runoff was found to be an intermittent source of enterococci to beach water, whereas groundwater exchange was of secondary importance. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the processes and coefficients related to enterococci loading have quasi-linear characteristics, whereas model results of enterococci levels were sensitive to both diffusion and sunlight inactivation coefficients, showing high nonlinearity and spatial and temporal dependence. © 2012.

	abstract = {The quality of morphodynamic predictions is generally expressed by an overall grid-point based skill score, which measures the relative accuracy of a morphological prediction over a prediction of zero morphological change, using the MSE as the accuracy measure. Through a generic ranking for morphodynamic model predictions, this (MSESS) aims at making model performance comparable across different prediction situations (geographical locations, forcing conditions, time periods, internal dynamics). The implicit assumptions underlying this approach are that the MSE is an appropriate measure of correspondence for morphological predictions and that the accuracy of the initial bed as the reference correctly reflects the inherent difficulty or ease of prediction situations. This paper presents a thorough analysis of the perception of model skill through the MSE skill score. Using synthetic examples, an example from literature and a long-yearly Delft3D model simulation, we demonstrate that unexpected skill may be reported due to a violation of either of the above assumptions. It is shown that the accuracy of the reference fails to reflect the relative difficulty of prediction situations with a different morphological development prior to the evaluation time (for instance trend, cyclic/seasonal, episodic, speed of the development). We further demonstrate that the MSESS tends to favor model results that underestimate the variance of cumulative bed changes, a feature inherited from the MSE. As a consequence of these limitations, the MSESS may report a relative ranking of predictions not matching the intuitive judgment of experts. Guidelines are suggested for how to adjust calibration and validation procedures to be more in line with a morphologist's expert judgment.},

	abstract = {Fecal indicator microbes, such as enterococci, are often used to assess potential health risks caused by pathogens at recreational beaches. Microbe levels often vary based on collection time and sampling location. The primary goal of this study was to assess how spatial and temporal variations in sample collection, which are driven by environmental parameters, impact enterococci measurements and beach management decisions. A secondary goal was to assess whether enterococci levels can be predictive of the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, a skin pathogen. Over a ten-day period, hydrometeorologic data, hydrodynamic data, bather densities, enterococci levels, and S. aureus levels including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were measured in both water and sand. Samples were collected hourly for both water and sediment at knee-depth, and every 6 h for water at waist-depth, supratidal sand, intertidal sand, and waterline sand. Results showed that solar radiation, tides, and rainfall events were major environmental factors that impacted enterococci levels. S. aureus levels were associated with bathing load, but did not correlate with enterococci levels or any other measured parameters. The results imply that frequencies of advisories depend heavily upon sample collection policies due to spatial and temporal variation of enterococci levels in response to environmental parameters. Thus, sampling at different times of the day and at different depths can significantly impact beach management decisions. Additionally, the lack of correlation between S. aureus and enterococci suggests that use of fecal indicators may not accurately assess risk for some pathogens. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

For a 3.5-h MV-ACDP simulation that spatially and temporally varies with the M2 tide, the 2D DF-estimated velocity magnitude and orientation improves by approximately 85\%. Next the 2D DF method was applied to velocity data obtained from two UUVs that repeatedly performed seven 1-h survey tracks in Bear Cut Inlet,Miami, Florida. The DFmethod provides a more realistic and consistent representation of the ADCP measured flow field, improving magnitude and orientation estimates by approximately 25\%. The improvement increases for lower flow velocities, when the ADCP measurements have lowenvironmental signal-to-noise ratio.However, near slack tide when flow reversal occurs, the DF estimates are invalid because the flows are not steady state within the survey circuit. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the circulation of estuaries and adjacent shelf waters has relied on hydrographic measurements, moorings, and local wind observations usually removed from the region of interest. Although these observations are certainly sufficient to identify major characteristics, they lack both spatial resolution and temporal coverage. High-resolution synoptic observations are required to identify important coastal processes at smaller scales. Long observation periods are needed to properly sample low-frequency processes that may also be important. The introduction of high-frequency (HF) radar measurements and regional wind models for coastal studies is changing this situation. Here we analyze synoptic, high-resolution surface winds and currents in the Delaware Bay mouth over an 8-month period (October 2007 through May 2008). The surface currents were measured by two HF radars while the surface winds were extracted from a data-assimilating regional wind model. To illustrate the utility of these monitoring tools we focus on two 45-day periods which previously were shown to present contrasting pictures of the circulation. One, the low-outflow period is from 1 October through 14 November 2007; the other is the high-outflow period from 3 March through 16 April 2008. The large-scale characteristics noted by previous workers are clearly corroborated. Specifically the M2 tide dominates the surface currents, and the Delaware Bay outflow plume is clearly evident in the low frequency currents. Several new aspects of the surface circulation were also identified. These include a map of the spatial variability of the M2 tide (validating an earlier model study), persistent low-frequency cross-mouth flow, and a rapid response of the surface currents to a changing wind field. However, strong wind episodes did not persist long enough to set up a sustained Ekman response. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The development of the wave field depends on wind, wave-wave and wave-current interactions and wave dissipation owing to breaking, which is accompanied by momentum fluxes from waves to currents. Wave breaking supports air-sea fluxes of heat and gas, which have a profound effect on weather and climate. But wave breaking is poorly quantified and understood. Here we present measurements of wave breaking, using aerial imaging and analysis, and provide a statistical description of related sea-surface processes. We find that the distribution of the length of breaking fronts per unit area of sea surface is proportional to the cube of the wind speed and that, within the measured range of the speed of the wave fronts, the length of breaking fronts per unit area is an exponential function of the speed of the front. We also find that the fraction of the ocean surface mixed by breaking waves, which is important for air-sea exchange, is dominated by wave breaking at low velocities and short wavelengths.},

The experiments exploit the dispersion of deep-water waves to generate a single breaking wave group. The direct effects of breaking are then confined to a finite region in the wave channel and the influence of breaking on the evolution of the wave field can be examined by measuring fluxes into and out of the breaking region. This technique was used by us in a preliminary series of measurements. The loss of excess momentum flux and energy flux from the wave group was measured and found to range from 10\% for single spilling events to as much as 25\% for plunging breakers. Mixing due to breaking was studied by photographing the evolution of a dye patch as it was mixed into the water column. It was found that the maximum depth of the dye cloud grew linearly in time for one to two wave periods, and then followed a t[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} power law (t is the time from breaking) over a range of breaking intensities and scales. The dyed region reached depths of two to three wave heights and horizontal lengths of approximately one wavelength within five wave periods of breaking. A detailed velocity survey of the breaking region was made and ensemble averages taken of the non-stationary flow. Mean surface currents in the range 0.02-0.03 C (C is the characteristic phase speed) were generated and took as many as 60 wave periods to decay to 0.005 C. A deeper return flow due to momentum lost from the forced long wave was measured. Together these flows gave a rotational region of approximately one wavelength. Turbulent root mean square velocities of approximately 0.02 C were measured near the surface and were still significant at depths of three to four wave heights. More than 90\% of the energy lost from the waves was dissipated within four wave periods. Subsequently measured kinetic energy in the residual flow was found to have a t[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} dependence. Correlation of all the above measurements with the amplitude, bandwidth and phase of the wave group was found to be good, as was scaling of the results with the centre frequency of the group.

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea has been recently proposed as one of the most impacted regions of the world with regards to microplastics, however the polymeric composition of these floating particles is still largely unknown. Here we present the results of a large-scale survey of neustonic micro-and meso-plastics floating in Mediterranean waters, providing the first extensive characterization of their chemical identity as well as detailed information on their abundance and geographical distribution. All particles {\textgreater}700 μm collected in our samples were identified through FT-IR analysis (n = 4050 particles), shedding for the first time light on the polymeric diversity of this emerging pollutant. Sixteen different classes of synthetic materials were identified. Low-density polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene were the most abundant compounds, followed by polyamides, plastic-based paints, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and polyvinyl alcohol. Less frequent polymers included polyethylene terephthalate, polyisoprene, poly(vinyl stearate), ethylene-vinyl acetate, polyepoxide, paraffin wax and polycaprolactone, a biodegradable polyester reported for the first time floating in off-shore waters. Geographical differences in sample composition were also observed, demonstrating sub-basin scale heterogeneity in plastics distribution and likely reflecting a complex interplay between pollution sources, sinks and residence times of different polymers at sea. Global production of plastic materials increased twenty-fold in the last fifty years, exceeding 300 million tonnes in 2015 1 . Demand is growing exponentially and production is expected to quadruple by 2050, taking up 20\% of total oil consumption and 15\% of the global carbon budget 2 . Single-use packaging applications represent the largest share of the European plastic market, accounting for 40\% of the total production 1 and for more than 10\% of the municipal solid waste 3 . As a result, 275 million tonnes of plastic litter were generated in 2010 by the world's coastal countries, of which 4.8 to 12.7 million tonnes were estimated to have ended up in the oceans, a scenario projected to increase by an order of magnitude within 2025 3 . Since the first reports on the presence of plastic in the oceans, worldwide attention has been focussed to this problem and the number of scientific publications has seen an exponential growth 4 . Vast accumulation areas have been discovered in all main oceanic gyres 5–8 , and every part of the oceans examined so far, revealed the presence of marine litter, including polar seas 9 and deep-sea sediments 10 . Plastic is now so abundant that it has been pro-posed as a new stratigraphic indicator of Anthropocene 11 . Over 92\% of all plastic items found at sea are generally smaller than 5 mm 12 . These tiny particles – hereinafter referred to as microplastics – may either result from the breakdown of larger objects, or they can directly enter the marine environment as granules, pellets and fibers. Microplastics can act as dispersal vectors of chemical additives, organic and metal pollutants accumulated from surrounding waters 13 and provide habitats for a wide range of rafting organisms and microbial communities 14 . Being in the same size class of many planktonic organ-isms, ingestion of microplastics is widely reported and the first evidences of trophic transfer are emerging 15,16 . As},

	abstract = {In this paper we report on a laboratory study, the Spray Production and Dynamics Experiment (SPANDEX), conducted at the University of New South Wales Water Research Laboratory in Australia. The goals of SPANDEX were to illuminate physical aspects of spume droplet production and dispersion; verify theoretical simplifications used to estimate the source function from ambient droplet concentration measurements; and examine the relationship between the implied source strength and forcing parameters such as wind speed, surface turbulent stress, and wave properties. Observations of droplet profiles give reasonable confirmation of the basic power law profile relationship that is commonly used to relate droplet concentrations to the surface source strength. This essentially confirms that, even in a wind tunnel, there is a near balance between droplet production and removal by gravitational settling. The observations also indicate considerable droplet mass may be present for sizes larger than 1.5 mm diameter. Phase Doppler Anemometry observations revealed significant mean horizontal and vertical slip velocities that were larger closer to the surface. The magnitude seems too large to be an acceleration time scale effect. Scaling of the droplet production surface source strength proved to be difficult. The wind speed forcing varied only 23\% and the stress increased a factor of 2.2. Yet, the source strength increased by about a factor of 7. We related this to an estimate of surface wave energy flux through calculations of the standard deviation of small-scale water surface disturbance, a wave-stress parameterization, and numerical wave model simulations. This energy index only increased by a factor of 2.3 with the wind forcing. Nonetheless, a graph of spray mass surface flux versus surface disturbance energy is quasi-linear with a substantial threshold.},

The proposed cubic relationship shows a weaker dependence of gas transfer at low wind speed and a significantly stronger dependence at high wind speed than previous relationships. A long-term relationship derived from such a dependence, combined with the monthly CO2 climatology of Takahashi [1997], leads to an increase in the global annual oceanic CO2 uptake from 1.4 Gigaton C yr(-1) to 2.2 Gigaton C yr(-1).

	abstract = {Amplitudes of semi-diurnal tidal fluctuations measured at an ocean inlet system decay nearly linearly by 87\% between the ocean edge of the offshore ebb-tidal delta and the backbay. A monochromatic, dynamical model for a tidally choked inlet separately reproduces the evolution of the amplitudes and phases of the semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal constituents observed between the ocean and inland locations. However, the monochromatic model over-predicts the amplitude and under-predicts the lag of the lower-frequency subtidal and fortnightly motions observed in the backbay. A dimensional model that considers all tidal constituents simultaneously, balances the along-channel pressure gradient with quadratic bottom friction, and that includes a time-varying channel water depth, is used to show that that these model-data differences are associated with nonlinear interactions between the tidal constituents that are not included in non-dimensional, monochromatic models. In particular, numerical simulations suggest that the nonlinear interactions induced by quadratic bottom friction modify the amplitude and phase of the subtidal and fortnightly backbay response. This nonlinear effect on the low-frequency (subtidal and fortnightly) motions increases with increasing high-frequency (semi-diurnal) amplitude. The subtidal and fortnightly motions influence water exchange processes, and thus backbay temperature and salinity.},

This Lagrangian current can be decomposed as the vector sum of a quasi-Eulerian current UE, representative of the top 1 m of the water column and part of the wave-induced Stokes drift Uss at the sea surface. Here, Uss is estimated with an accurate numerical wave model using a novel parameterization of wave dissipation processes. Using both observed and modeled wave spectra, Uss is found to be very well approximated by a simple function of the wind speed and significant wave height, generally increasing quadratically with the wind speed.

Relationships between the non-dimensional shear, development of internal boundary layers and wave state are explored. We find that the largest-scale turbulent eddies are suppressed in shallow convective internal boundary layers, leading to larger non-dimensional shear than that of the traditional prediction based only on stability. In shallow stable boundary layers, elevated generation of turbulence leads to smaller non-dimensional shear compared to the traditional prediction. Over young growing waves in stable stratification, the observed non-dimensional shear is less than that over older more mature waves in otherwise similar conditions. The non-dimensional shear is a function of wave state for stable conditions even though the observations are well above the wave boundary layer. We conclude that development of shallow internal boundary layers and young growing-wave fields, both of which are common in the coastal zone, can lead to substantial departures of the non-dimensional shear from the prediction based only on stability.},

Measurements of the drag coefficient, relating the tangential stress (frictional drag) between wind and water to the wind speed and air density, have yielded reliable information in wind speeds less than 20 m/s (about 39 knots). In these moderate conditions it is generally accepted that the drag coefficient (or equivalently, the “aerodynamic roughness”) increases with the wind speed. Can one merely extrapolate this wind speed tendency to describe the aerodynamic roughness of the ocean in the extreme wind speeds that occur in hurricanes (wind speeds greater than 30 m/s)? This paper attempts to answer this question, guided by laboratory extreme wind experiments, and concludes that the aerodynamic roughness approaches a limiting value in high winds.

This ratio increases to 18 times for periods with frequent wave breaking. The depth-integrated mean dissipation rate is a function of the wave field and correlates well with the mean wave saturation in the wave band ωp ≤ ω ≤ 4ωp. It shows a clear threshold behavior in accordance with the onset of wave breaking.

The source functions that drive the space-time evolution of the energy spectra are developed in form based on theory and laboratory and field experiments. The calibration factors (proportionality constants of the source functions) are determined from a comparison of modeled and observed significant height and mean period. The observations are for the month of January 2005 and are derived from an array of laser range finders mounted on a bridge between two platforms in the Ekofisk oil field in the North Sea. The model calculates the form stress on the waves and adds it vectorially to the sheltering-modified skin stress. The resulting drag coefficient versus wind speed is shown to have the observed structure: low in light winds, increasing in moderate winds, and increasing more slowly in very strong winds. Modeled spectral shapes in the four quadrants of Hurricane Bonnie (1998) match the Scanning Radar Altimeter measurements. Modeled spectral properties in Hurricane Ike (2008) are compared against NDBC buoy estimates with good results. Drag coefficients in the mixed seas produced by hurricanes show dependence on wave age of the wind sea, swell propagation direction, and water depth. The need for wave and stress modeling for atmosphere-ocean coupling is emphasized. The new wave model has all the necessary attributes to be the basis for such a coupler.},

Dimensionless wind gradients phi(m)(z/L) for (i) stable conditions are linear in z/L (L is the Obukhov length); (ii) unstable, growing sea conditions are much smaller than predicted by 'standard' equations, due to an indirect effect of the boundary layer height.

An error analysis of the inertial-dissipation method indicates that stress is most accurately measured in near-neutral conditions, whereas scalar fluxes are most accurately measured in near-neutral and unstable conditions. It is also shown that the inertial-disspation stress estimates are much less affected by the flow distortion caused by the platform as well as by the boom itself. The inertial-dissipation (boom and mast) and boom covariance estimates of stress agree within +/-20\%. The latent heat flux estimates agree within approximately +/-45\%. The sensible heat flux estimates agree within +/-26\% after correction for velocity contamination of the sonic temperature spectra. The larger uncertainty in the latent heat fluxes is due to poor performance of our Lyman-α hygrometers in the sea spray environment. Improved parameterizations for the stability dependence of the dimensionless humidity and temperature structure functions are given. These functions are used to find a best fit for effective Kolmogorov contants of 0.55 for velocity (assuming a balance of production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy) and 0.79 for temperature and humidity. A Kolmogorov constant of 0.51 implies a conditions.},

The method, known as polarimetric slope sensing (PSS), uses the relationship between surface orientation and the change in polarization of reflected light to infer the instantaneous two-dimensional slope across the field-of-view of an imaging polarimeter. For unpolarized skylight, the polarization orientation and degree of linear polarization of the reflected skylight provide sufficient information to determine the local surface slope vectors. A controlled laboratory experiment was carried out in a wave tank with mechanically generated gravity waves. A second study was performed from a pier on the Hudson River, near Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. We demonstrated that the two-dimensional slope field of short gravity waves could be recovered accurately without interfering with the fluid dynamics of the air or water, and water surface features appear remarkably realistic. The combined field and laboratory results demonstrate that the polarimetric camera gives a robust characterization of the fine-scale surface wave features that are intrinsic to wind-driven airsea interaction processes.},

The observed wind energy input function is found to follow a much narrower distribution (β 3.6θ) than the Plant (1982) cosine distribution. The observation of negative stress angles at large wind-wave angles, however, indicates that the onset of negative wind shearing occurs at about θ 50°, and supports the use of the Snyder et al. (1981) directional distribution. Taking into account the reverse momentum transfer from swell to the wind, Snyder's proposed parameterization is found to perform exceptionally well in explaining the observed narrow directional distribution of the wind energy input function, and predicting the wind drag coefficients. The empirical coefficient (ε) in Snyder's parameterization is hypothesised to be a function of the wave shape parameter, with ε value increasing as the wave shape changes between sinusoidal, sawtooth, and sharp-crested shoaling waves.},

A direct comparison of experimental and numerical data shows that, as long as the nonlinearity is small, the second-order model describes the statistical properties of field data very accurately. By low-pass filtering the Lake George time series, there is evidence that some energetic wave groups are accompanied by a setup instead of a setdown. A numerical study of the coupling coefficient of the second-order model reveals that such an experimental result is consistent with the second-order theory, provided directional spreading is included in the wave spectrum. In particular, the coupling coefficient of the second-order difference contribution predicts a setup as a result of the interaction of two waves with the same frequency but with different directions. This result is also confirmed by numerical simulations. Bispectral analysis, furthermore, indicates that this setup is a statistically significant feature of the observed wave records.},

The emphasis here is on this latter topic, where uncertainty over the spray generation function, especially in high winds, is a major obstacle. This paper surveys the spray generation functions available in the literature and, on theoretical grounds, focuses on one by M. H. Smith et al. that has some desirable properties but does not cover a wide enough droplet size range to be immediately useful for quantifying spray heat transfer. With reasonable modifications and extrapolations, however, the paper casts the Smith function into a new form that can be used to predict the production of sea spray droplets with radii from 2 to 500 mm for 10-m winds from 0 to 32.5 m s21.

The analysis of an atmospheric and wave data set collected in finite water depth at the Lake George measurement site (Australia) suggests that this variability relates to a number of parameters at the air-sea interface other than wind speed alone. In particular, results indicate that the sea drag depends on water depth and wave steepness, which make the wave profile more vertically asymmetric, and the concentration of water vapor in the air, which modifies air density and friction velocity. These dependencies are used to derive parametric functions based on the combined contribution of wind, waves and relative humidity.

The total surface drift current, the sum of wind- and wave-induced components, decreases gradually with increasing fetch and approaches 3.1\% of wind velocity at long fetches, comparing very favorably with measured values. At a slick surface, the wind-induced drift current is reduced due to a decrease of the wind-stress coefficient, and the wave-induced mass transport is increased due to an additional wave damping.

	abstract = {[1] A new radar imaging model of ocean current features is proposed. The simulated normalized radar cross section ( NRCS) takes into account scattering from "regular'' surfaces ( by means of resonant Bragg scattering and specular reflections) and scattering from breaking waves. The description of background wind waves and their transformation in nonuniform medium is based on solution of the wave action conservation equation. Wave breaking plays a key role in the radar imaging model. Breaking waves scatter radio waves ( thus directly contributing to the NRCS), provide energy dissipation in wind waves ( thus defining the wave spectrum of intermediate scale waves), and generate short surface waves ( thus affecting Bragg scattering). Surface current, surfactants accumulated in the convergence zone, and varying wind field are considered as the main sources for the NRCS manifestations of current features. The latter source can result from transformation of atmospheric boundary layer over the sea surface temperature front. It is shown that modulation of wave breaking significantly influences both radar returns and short wind waves. In the range of short gravity waves related to Ku-X-, and C-bands, the modulation of Bragg waves through wave breaking is the governing mechanism. The model is tested against well-controlled experiments including JOWIP, SARSEX, and CoastWatch-95. A reasonably good agreement between model and observations is obtained.},

	abstract = {The air-sea coupling is usually parameterized in terms of the drag coefficient C d , but the scatter of experimental data around such dependences is very significant and has not improved noticeably over some 30 years. In the paper, which is meant to be the first in a series, a complex approach to the problem is suggested. Multiple mechanisms, contributing into the sea drag, are to be singled out, studied separately, evaluated and then reunited in a joint parameterization for C d . Dependences of the drag coefficient on the wind speed and sea state, and effects of wind trends and gustiness are investigated in detail. Gustiness is found to be responsible for the most distant outliers. Our approach also combines an experimental Lake George study with theoretical investigations conducted by means of the WOWC (Wind-Over-Waves Coupling) model. Overall agreement of the model with measured wind stresses is quite good, within 20\% for the bulk of the data. Lower envelopes of the drag dependences are an important result of the paper. They provide some Lake George ``ideal'' relationships for the sea drag. Almost any deviation from such conditions causes the drag to increase. It is suggested that decrease of the drag with respect to the ideal conditions, which exhibits itself in a number of known open ocean data sets, would be caused by a momentum flux back from the waves to the wind due to long waves outrunning the wind. Behavior of the Charnock parameter in terms of wave age is also considered.},

	abstract = {To study the fetch-limited growth of wind wave energy over a region with significant lateral shear of the current field, this study exploited data obtained from two linear phased-array High Frequency (HF) radar systems. Both the near-surface currents and wave energy and period were mapped over the highly sheared inshore boundary of the Florida Current. The wave energy growth during two periods when the winds were steady for \{{\textgreater}\} 12 hours and were directed offshore was computed over a range of fetches from 5 to 45 km. The observed energy growth rates were significantly (∼50 \{\%\}) lower than predicted by the Donelan et al. (1992) empirical formulation over the high vorticity region. The reduced growth rate was consistent with a shift of the wind stress direction into the current direction due to refraction of the wave field. Dimensionless wave energy increased by as much as 100\{\%\} over neighboring values when the vertical component of the surface current vorticity was a global minimum. While trapping and enhancement of wave energy is predicted by wave ray theory, it has never before been confirmed within the Florida Current with coincident wave and current measurements.

	abstract = {[1] This paper investigates the interplay between river discharge and winds in forcing coastal buoyant outflows. During light winds a plume influenced by the Earth's rotation will flow down shelf (in the direction of Kelvin wave propagation) as a slender buoyancy-driven coastal current. Downwelling favorable winds augment this down-shelf flow, narrow the plume, and mix the water column. Upwelling favorable winds drive currents that counter the buoyancy-driven flow, spread plume waters offshore, and rapidly mix buoyant waters. Two criteria are developed to assess the wind influence on a buoyant outflow. The wind strength index (Ws) determines whether a plume's along-shelf flow is in a wind-driven or buoyancy-driven state. Ws is the ratio of the wind-driven and buoyancy-driven along-shelf velocities. Wind influence on across-shelf plume structure is rated with a timescale (ttilt) for the isopycnal tilting caused by wind-driven Ekman circulation. These criteria are used to characterize wind influence on the Delaware Coastal Current and can be applied to other coastal buoyant outflows. The Delaware buoyant outflow is simulated for springtime high–river discharge conditions. Simulation results and Ws values reveal that the coastal current is buoyancy-driven most of the time (∣Ws∣ {\textless} 1 on average). Wind events, however, overwhelm the buoyancy-driven flow (∣Ws∣ {\textgreater} 1) several times during the high-discharge period. Strong upwelling events reverse the buoyant outflow; they constitute an important mechanism for transporting fresh water up shelf. Across-shelf plume structure is more sensitive to wind influence than the along-shelf flow. Values of ttilt indicate that moderate or strong winds persisting throughout a day can modify plume width significantly. Plume widening during upwelling events is accompanied by mixing that can erase the buoyant outflow.},

	abstract = {Theoretically, potential waves cannot generate the vortex motion, but scale considerations indicate that if the steepness of waves is not too small, Reynolds number can exceed critical values. This means that in presence of initial non-potential disturbances the orbital velocities can generate the vortex motion and turbulence. In the paper, this problem was investigated numerically on basis of full two-dimensional (x-z) equations of potential motion with the free surface in cylindrical conformal coordinates. It was assumed that all variables are a sum of the 2D potential orbital velocities and 3D non-potential disturbances. The non-potential motion is described directly with 3D Euler equations, with very high resolution. The interaction between potential orbital velocities and non-potential components is accounted through additional terms which include the components of vorticity. Long-term numerical integration of the system of equations was done for different wave steepness. Vorticity and turbulence usually occur in vicinity of wave crests (where the velocity gradients reach their maximum) and then spread over upwind slope and downward. Specific feature of the wave turbulence at low steepness (steepness was kept low in order to avoid wave breaking) is its strong intermittency: the turbulent patches are mostly isolated and intermittency grows with decrease of wave amplitude. Maximum values of energy of turbulence are in agreement with available experimental data. The results suggest that even non-breaking potential waves can generate turbulence, which thus enhances the turbulence created by the shear current.},

	abstract = {Numerical experiments are conducted to investigate how axial winds affect stratification and circulation in the partially mixed estuary of Chesapeake Bay. In the absence of rotational effects, stratification in the estuary decreases following both down-estuary and up-estuary winds, but stratification experiences larger reduction and takes longer to recover under up-estuary winds. In the presence of rotational effects, wind-driven lateral circulations cause the lateral straining of density field and weaken the shear in the along-channel flows. Under the down-estuary winds, a counterclockwise lateral circulation steepens isopycnals in the cross-channel sections, while the Coriolis force acting on it decelerates the downwind current in the surface layer and the upwind-directed current in the bottom layer. Under the up-estuary winds, a clockwise lateral circulation flattens isopycnals in the cross-channel sections and reduces the shear between the surface and bottom currents. Hence, in the presence of rotational effects, the lateral straining offsets the effects of longitudinal straining such that the asymmetry in stratification reduction is significantly reduced between the down-estuary and up-estuary winds. Regime diagrams based on Wedderburn (W) and Kelvin (Ke) numbers are constructed to summarize the net effects of winds on estuarine stratification during both wind perturbation and postwind adjustment periods.},

The main result of the analysis is that the dependence of the dimensionless wave spectrum on the dimensionless wind friction velocity follows a power law function. The coefficient and exponent of the power law function vary systematically with the wave number. The wave number dependence of the coefficient and exponent serves as an empirical parameterization for computing the wave number spectra of intermediate-scale waves at different wind speeds. Calculation of the mean square slope from the resulting wave number spectrum confirms that intermediate-scale waves are the dominant contributor of the ocean surface roughness. A simple formula is presented for calculating the band-pass filtered mean square slope of the ocean surface for remote sensing applications.},

Normalized radar cross section (NRCS) and Doppler velocity are estimated from microwave measurements at near-grazing angles, and in situ fluid velocities are measured with acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs). Joint histograms of radar cross section and Doppler velocity cluster into identifiable distributions. The NRCS values from pixels with large NRCS and high Doppler velocities ({\textgreater}2 m/s) decrease with decreasing bore height to the shoreline, similar to scattering from a cylinder with decreasing radius. The Doppler velocities associated with these regions in the histograms agree well with theoretical wave phase velocities. Radar and ADV measurements of fluid velocities between bore crests have similarly shaped energy density spectra for frequencies above about 0.1 Hz, but energy levels from the radar are an order of magnitude higher than those of the ADV data. Instantaneous interbore Doppler velocities are correlated with ADV measured fluid velocities but are offset by 0.8 m/s. This offset may be due to Bragg wave phase velocities, wind drift, range and azimuth sidelobes, the finite spatial resolution of the radar, and differences between mean flows measured at the surface with radar and flows measured below the surface with ADVs. Shoaling and breaking waves measured through radar grating lobes significantly affect both the Doppler velocities near the edges of the images and the scattering from the rear faces of waves, causing large Doppler velocities to be observed in these regions.},

The present investigation relies on both experimental and numerical approaches. Turbulent velocities at the water surface were measured in a laboratory wave tank with high precision using the thermal-marking velocimetry technique. Numerically, a fully nonlinear model for the wave motion was coupled with Large Eddy Simulation for the turbulent motion. The results confirm the turbulence production due to wave motion. The turbulent kinetic energy was found to be a function of time, wave steepness, wave phase, and initial turbulent conditions. Additionally, turbulent motion near the surface was found to be horizontally anisotropic due to the formation of near-surface eddies, elongated in the direction of wave propagation.},

In this context, two intensive field experiments using R/P Floating Instrument Platform were staged within the Office of Naval Research's Radiance in a Dynamic Ocean (RaDyO) field program in the Santa Barbara Channel and in the central Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii. As part of this program, our team gathered and analyzed a comprehensive suite of sea surface roughness measurements designed to provide optimal coverage of fundamental optical distortion processes associated with the air-sea interface. This contribution describes the ensemble of instrumentation deployed. It provides a detailed documentation of the ambient environmental conditions that prevailed during the RaDyO field experiments. It also highlights exciting new sea surface roughness measurement capabilities that underpin a number of the scientific advances resulting from the RaDyO program. For instance, a new polarimetric imaging camera highlights the complex interplay of wind and surface currents in shaping the roughness of the sea surface that suggests the traditional Cox-Munk framework is not sufficient. In addition, the breaking crest length spectral density derived from visible and infrared imagery is shown to be modulated by the development of the wavefield (wave age) and alignment of wind and surface currents at the intermediate (dominant) scale of wave breaking.},

Hydrodynamics control the transport of nutrients, food particles, larvae and spores at scales ranging from boundary layers around individual blades to entire kelp forests. Our measurements include vertical profiles of current and temperature, and concurrent wave measurements, at a number of different locations in and around a kelp forest at Santa Cruz, California. We find that flow at the site is dominated by variations at diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies. A vertically sheared across-shore flow, consistent with flow driven by an across-shore density gradient, is thought to be important for exchange between the kelp forest and the surrounding coastal ocean. Within the kelp forest, currents are reduced by a factor that correlates with surface canopy coverage, higher frequency internal waves are damped, and onshore transport due to waves (Stokes drift) is estimated to be similar in magnitude to that due to currents. Richardson numbers within the kelp forest are higher than those outside the kelp forest and indicate that the water column within the kelp forest is usually stable to turbulence generation by mean velocity shear.

	abstract = {We show that if ocean surface waves of the order of a few meters long are frequently steep enough to generate bound centimetric waves, then composite surface scattering theory can account for many anomalous properties of microwave backscatter from the sea at high incidence angles. The model proposed here postulates that these intermediate waves are made sufficiently steep to generate bound centimetric waves because of their modulation by longer, dominant ocean surface waves. The bound centimetric waves have a nonzero mean tilt because they are located on the steep forward face of the intermediate waves, and they move at the speed of the intermediate waves. Applying composite surface scattering theory to this sea surface model, we show that much of the apparently anomalous behavior of microwave sea return measured at incidence angles between 50° and 80° during the Synthetic Aperture Radar and X Band Ocean Nonlinarities-Forschungsplatform Nordsee (SAXON-FPN) experiment can be explained using reasonable parameters to characterize the surface waves. In the SAXON-FPN measurements the mean values of the first moments of microwave Doppler spectra for horizontally polarized backscatter differ from those for vertically polarized backscatter by an amount which varies with the incidence angle and with the azimuthal angle between the radar look direction and the direction of the dominant wave. The modulation of this first moment by surface waves tens of meters in length is the same for the two polarizations at low to moderate incidence angles and can be interpreted in terms of the advection of free centimetric waves by the long waves. At higher incidence angles, however, this modulation is different for the two polarizations and cannot be explained by simple advection of free waves. Finally, microwave cross sections measured at high incidence angles using horizontal polarization are much larger than can be explained by a composite surface theory that includes only freely propagating centimetric waves. Most of these effects can be explained by the composite surface model presented here, which includes Bragg scattering from both free and bound, tilted waves.},

Surface current fields off Duck, North Carolina, were measured by a high-frequency Ocean Surface Current Radar (OSCR). Wind, wind stress, and directional wave data were obtained from several Air Sea Interaction Spar (ASIS) buoys moored in the OSCR scanning domain. At several times during the experiment, significant coastal currents entered the experimental area. High horizontal shears at the current edge resulted in the waves at the peak of wind-sea spectra (but not those in the higher-frequency equilibrium range) being shifted away from the mean wind direction. This led to a significant turning of the wind stress vector away from the mean wind direction. The interactions presented here have important applications in radar remote sensing and are discussed in the context of recent radar imaging models of the ocean surface.},

	doi = {10.1029/2010JC006458},
	abstract = {The sea spray generation function dF/dr(0) predicts the rate at which droplets of initial radius r(0) are produced at the sea surface. Because this function is not readily measurable in the marine environment, however, it is often inferred from measurements of the near-surface droplet concentration, C(r(0)), through an assumed velocity scale, the effective spray production velocity. This paper proceeds in reverse, though: It uses a reliable estimate of dF/dr(0) and 13 sets of measurements of C(r(0)) over the ocean to calculate the implied effective production velocity, V-eff, for droplets with initial radii r(0) from 5 to 300 mu m. It then compares these V-eff values with four candidate expressions for this production velocity: the dry-deposition velocity, V-Dh; the mean wind speed at the significant wave amplitude (A(1/3)), U-A1/3; the standard deviation in vertical droplet velocity, sigma(wd); and laboratory measurements of the ejection velocity of jet droplets, V-ej. The velocity scales U-A1/3 and V-ej agree best with the implied V-eff values for 20 {\textless}= r(0) {\textless}= 300 mu m. The deposition velocity, V-Dh, which is the velocity most commonly used in this application, agrees worst with the Veff values. For droplets with r(0) less than about 20 mu m, the analysis also rejects the main hypothesis: that dF/dr(0) and C(r(0)) can be related through a velocity scale. These smaller droplets simply have residence times that are too long for spray concentrations to be in local equilibrium with the spray production rate.},

These processes mediate exchanges of momentum, heat, and gases between the atmosphere and ocean and thus are of global significance for climate. Surface waves grow primarily by pressure-form stress from airflow over the waveforms, and they dissipate in the open sea by wave breaking that injects and stirs momentum, energy, and bubbles into the ocean. Wave motions pump wind eddies that control fluxes across the lower atmosphere. Flow separation occurs behind steep wave crests, and at high winds the crests flatten into spume, which diminishes the drag coefficient. In the ocean the Lagrangian-mean wave velocity, Stokes drift, induces a vortex force and material transport. These generate Langmuir circulations penetrating throughout the boundary layer and enhancing entrainment at the stratified interior interface in combination with other turbulent eddies and inertial-shear instability.},

From the results, the time evolution of the physical entrainment of nutrient is not driven by the wind stress per se, but by the wind-surface current interaction. More importantly, it appears that the interaction between the time variability of the wind stress and the Coriolis period (which acts on the surface inertial currents and hence their phase direction with respect to the wind stress) can induce a pulsing character, at a time scale of some hours, of the nutrient flux through the thermocline. Because of the non-linear processes involved, the interaction has an effect not only on the instantaneous nutrient distribution, but also on the mean level of the nutrient transported. © 1984.},

	abstract = {A bulk air-sea flux algorithm couples the ocean and the lower atmosphere through flux boundary conditions and can be used in various analyses and in numerical models. The algorithm described here has two features not present in any other existing bulk flux algorithm. First, it has a new air-sea drag relation. Here, for wind speeds above about 9 m s–1, the friction velocity u*, which is related to the square root of the surface stress, is linearly related to UN10, the neutral-stability, 10-metre wind speed. When extrapolated to hurricane-strength winds, this drag relation has better properties than relations formulated in terms of a drag coefficient or a roughness length. The second unique feature of this flux algorithm is that it recognizes two routes by which heat and moisture cross the air-sea interface: one is the interfacial route that is controlled by molecular processes right at the air-sea interface; the second is the spray-mediated route that is governed by microphysical processes at the surface of sea spray droplets. Through microphysical theory and our analysis of 4000 sets of eddy-covariance measurements of the scalar fluxes, we separate the measured fluxes into the interfacial and spray contributions and thereby produce the only spray flux algorithm tested and validated against oceanic data. Because all components of our flux algorithm are physics based and validated with data for winds up to 25 m s–1, one application is extrapolating this algorithm to hurricane-strength winds, where sea spray plays a dominant role in scalar transfer.},

An indirect calorimetric (heat content budget) measurement technique yielded accurate determinations of moist enthalpy flux over the full range of wind speeds. These winds included conditions with significant spray generation, the concentrations of which were of the same order as field observations. The moist enthalpy exchange coefficient so measured included a contribution from cooled reentrant spray and therefore serves as an upper limit for the interfacial transfer of enthalpy. An unknown quantity of spray was also observed to exit the tank without evaporating. By invoking an air volume enthalpy budget it was determined that the potential contribution of this exiting spray over an unbounded water volume was up to 28\%.

	abstract = {The horizontal and vertical structure of the mean flow and turbulent fluxes are examined using aircraft observations taken near a barrier island on the east coast of the United States during offshore flow periods. The spatial structure is strongly influenced by the surface roughness and surface temperature discontinuities at the coast. With offshore flow of warm air over cool water, the sea surface momentum flux is large near the coast and decreases rapidly with increasing offshore distance or travel time. The decrease is attributed to advection and decay of turbulence from land. The rate of decrease is dependent on the characteristic timescale of the eddies in the upstream land-based boundary layer that are advected over the ocean. As a consequence, the air-sea momentum exchange near the coast is influenced by upstream conditions and similarity theory is not adequate to predict the flux. The vertical structure reveals an elevated layer of downward momentum flux and turbulence energy maxima over the ocean. This increase in the momentum flux with height contributes to acceleration of the low-level mean wind. In the momentum budget, the vertical advection term, vertical flux divergence term, and the horizontal pressure gradient term are all of comparable magnitude and all act to balance large horizontal advection. An interpolation technique is applied to the aircraft data to develop fetch-height cross sections of the mean flow and momentum flux that are suitable for future verification of numerical models.},

	abstract = {Concern about marine litter has been rising in the last decades, triggered by the discovery of the great mid-ocean garbage patches. The Mediterranean Sea is strongly affected by the presence of floating litter, as it has a very high amount of waste generated annually per person that eventually ends up in its waters, with plastic objects accounting for a large percentage of all manmade debris. In principle, the basin looks very vulnerable to possible accumulation of floating debris, since its dynamics is characterized by an inward surface flow of water from the Atlantic hampering surface floating items from being flushed out. Yet, no evidence of permanent litter accumulation areas has been reported so far in the Mediterranean. In this paper we utilized the largest available set of historical Lagrangian data gathered in the Mediterranean Sea to estimate the probability of debris particles to reach different subareas of the basin, with the main objective of singling out possible retention areas. Climatological reconstructions of the time evolution of litter distribution in the basin carried out on the basis of observed Lagrangian displacements suggest a general tendency of floating matter to collect in the southern portion of the basin, and in particular a long term accumulation in the southern and southeastern Levantine basin, areas not yet sampled by marine litter observation campaigns, whose targeted organization we strongly recommend at the end of this paper.},

This paper introduces the 25-yr heat flux analysis and documents variability of the global ocean heat flux fields on seasonal, interannual, decadal, and longer time scales suggested by the new dataset. The study showed that, among all the climate signals investigated, the most striking is a long-term increase in latent heat flux that dominates the data record.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to find a combination of optimal numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward–backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the local variations in density field, while maintaining the computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate computational cost of expensive physical parameterization of mixing processes and submodels.},

Here we construct a hierarchy of ocean–atmosphere models operating at multiple scales within a 1 × 1° domain of the Belizean Barrier Reef (BBR). The various components of the atmosphere–ocean models are evaluated with in situ observations of surface drifters, wind and sea surface temperature. First, we compare the dispersion and velocity of 55 surface drifters released in the field in summer 2013 to the dispersion and velocity of simulated drifters under alternative model configurations. Increasing the resolution of the ocean model (from 1/12° to 1/100°, from 1 day to 1h) and atmosphere model forcing (from 1/2° to 1/100°, from 6h to 1h), and incorporating tidal forcing incrementally reduces discrepancy between simulated and observed velocities and dispersion. Next, in trying to understand why the high-resolution models improve prediction, we find that resolving both the diurnal sea-breeze and semi-diurnal tides is key to improving the Lagrangian statistics and transport predictions along the BBR. Notably, the model with the highest ocean–atmosphere resolution and with tidal forcing generates a higher number of looping trajectories and sub-mesoscale coherent structures that are otherwise unresolved. Finally, simulations conducted with this model from June to August of 2013 show an intensification of the velocity fields throughout the summer and reveal a mesoscale anticyclonic circulation around Glovers Reef, and sub-mesoscale cyclonic eddies formed in the vicinity of Columbus Island. This study provides a general framework to assess the best surface transport prediction from alternative ocean–atmosphere models using metrics derived from high frequency drifters’ data and meteorological stations.},

A particle tracking model, where surface ocean currents were given by a combination of a reanalysis ocean current product and Stokes drift computed separately by a wave model, simulated particle movement. The model results corresponded with the field survey. Modeled results indicated the micro- and mesoplastics are moved northeastward by the Tsushima Current. Subsequently, Stokes drift selectively moves mesoplastics during winter toward the Japanese coast, resulting in increased contributions of mesoplastics south of 39°N. Additionally, Stokes drift also transports micro- and mesoplastics out to the sea area south of the subpolar front where the northeastward Tsushima Current carries them into the open ocean via the Tsugaru and Soya straits. Average transit time of modeled particles in the Sea of Japan is drastically reduced when including Stokes drift in the model.},

ADCP crossings provide transport rates for Channel 2, Channel 5, Long Key Channel and the Seven Mile Bridge channels. Predictions of tidal current speed and water level provide mid-channel, vertically-integrated transport for times corresponding to total channel transport given by the ADCP data. For Channel 2, Channel 5 and Long Key Channel, flood and ebb tide data are separated, and results from the surveys are pooled. Total channel transport is regressed against mid-channel transport, and the slope of the regression equation serves as a conversion factor to translate time series of mid-channel transport into time series of total channel transport. Tidal transport is estimated for the principal tidal constituents in each channel. M2 total flood and ebb discharges vary from 13.13 x 106 m3 for Channel 2 to 122.60 x 106 m3 for the Seven Mile Bridge channels. Time series of mid-channel current speed and bottom pressure from Long Key Channel are used to investigate the response to wind forcing. The mean mid-channel current speed is an inflow of 2.4 cm s-1, and the mean transport is an inflow of 32 m3 s-1. Both are the result of forcing by strong east-northeasterly winds typical of the fall season.},

Percent drift varied with wind tunnel height. Extrapolation to infinite height indicated that on calm open water wind drift should be 3.7\%. Shallow water waves, which produced no significant drift themselves, reduced wind drift. Analysis indicated that deep water waves produced by the wind should produce significant drift, complicating wind drift prediction, but the magnitude of the wind wave interaction effects is not yet known. Test wind drifts and current drifts were found not to be directly additive.},

However, such observations provide a 'snapshot' of local conditions at a given time and cannot be used to deduce the provenance of the litter or to predict its fate, crucial information for management and mitigation policies. Particle tracking techniques have seen extensive use in these roles, however, most previous studies have used simplistic initial conditions based on bulk average inputs of debris to the system. Here, observations of floating anthropogenic macro debris in the Adriatic Sea are used to define initial conditions (number of particles, location, and time) in a Lagrangian particle tracking model. Particles are advected backward and forward in time for 60 days (120 days total) using surface velocities from an operational regional ocean model. Sources and sinks for debris observed in the central and southern Adriatic in May 2013 and March 2015 included the Italian coastline from Pescara to Brindisi, the Croatian island of Mljet, and the coastline from Dubrovnik through Montenegro to Albania. Debris observed in the northern Adriatic originated from the Istrian peninsula to the Italian city of Termoli, as well as the Croatian island of Cres and the Kornati archipelago. Particles spent a total of roughly 47 days afloat. Coastal currents, notably the eastern and western Adriatic currents, resulted in large alongshore displacements. Our results indicate that anthropogenic macro debris originates largely from coastal sources near population centers and is advected by the cyclonic surface circulation until it strands on the southwest (Italian) coast, exits the Adriatic, or recirculates in the southern gyre.},

An experimental study of the remote sensing of water wave elevations, through the application of stereo photogrammetry, is presented. This method uses two spatially offset cameras, with overlapping fields of view, to determine water surface elevation. This remote sensing approach provides data with excellent spatial coverage and spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, the hardware needs are minimal and the system is quickly deployed, calibrated, and operational. In the present study, a phased approach was taken, with medium scale (domain {\textasciitilde}50m2) laboratory experiments being followed by a large scale (domain {\textasciitilde}103-104m2) field test of the method. In the laboratory, reconstructed surface elevations were validated using a pressure sensor and demonstrated excellent agreement. In the field, measured wave heights and periods were found to agree well with available buoy data. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Microplastics are both abundant and widespread within the marine environment, found in their highest concentrations along coastlines and within mid-ocean gyres.

The measurements were made from a shore-connected platform at varying water depths from 1.2 m down to 20 cm. Wind conditions and the geometry of the lake were such that fetch-limited conditions with fetches ranging from approximately 10 km down to 1 km prevailed. The resulting waves were intermediate-depth wind waves with inverse wave ages in the range 1 {\textless} U10/Cp {\textless}8. The atmospheric input, bottom friction, and whitecap dissipation were measured directly and synchronously by an integrated measurement system, described in the paper. In addition, simultaneous data defining the directional wave spectrum, atmospheric boundary layer profile, and atmospheric turbulence were available. The contribution to the spectral evolution due to nonlinear interactions of various orders is investigated by a combination of bispectral analysis of the data and numerical modeling. The relatively small scale of the lake enabled experimental conditions such as the wind field and bathymetry to be well defined. The observations were conducted over a 3-yr period, from September 1997 to August 2000, with a designated intensive measurement period [the Australian Shallow Water Experiment (AUSWEX)] carried out in August-September 1999.

	abstract = {Competent larvae of intertidal invertebrates have to migrate toward shore for settlement; however, their migration through the surf zone is not understood. We investigated larval transport mechanisms at a rip-channeled beach. Because tracking larvae in the surf zone is infeasible, we used a three-dimensional biophysical model to simulate the processes. The coupled model consists of a physical module for currents and waves, and a biological module for adding larval traits and behaviors as well as Stokes drift to Lagrangian particles. Model calculations were performed with and without onshore wind forcing. Without wind, wave-driven onshore streaming occurs in the bottom boundary layer outside the surf zone. With onshore wind, onshore currents occur near the surface. In the surf zone, offshore-directed rip currents and compensating onshore-directed currents over shoals are formed in both no-wind and wind cases. In the biological module, neutral, negative, and positive buoyant particles were released offshore. Additionally, particles either sank in the presence of turbulence or not. Two scenarios achieved successful onshore migration: Negatively buoyant larvae without wind forcing sink in the turbulent bottom boundary layer and are carried onshore by streaming; positively buoyant larvae drift toward shore in wind-driven surface currents to the surf zone, then sink in the turbulent surf zone and remain near the bottom while transported shoreward. In both cases, the larval concentration is highest in the rip channel, consistent with field data. This successful result is only obtained if turbulence-dependent sinking behavior and Stokes drift are included in the transport of larvae. © 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

	abstract = {The effects of a Macrocystis pyrifera forest on currents and turbulence were investigated in a controlled laboratory setting using a dynamically matched 1/25-scale model. Two kelp configurations with surface canopies and one without a surface canopy were considered. Profiles of mean velocities and turbulence statistics were measured using acoustic Doppler velocimeters. Since flow within the model kelp forest was very heterogeneous, spatially averaged forms of the governing equations were used for the analysis. Stress gradients were small compared with pressure gradient, drag, and acceleration terms of the momentum budget. A good model for kelp drag is therefore required for simulating flow through a kelp forest, while the model for Reynolds and dispersive stresses is less critical. The bulk drag coefficient is highest at the up-current end of a kelp forest and decays with down-current distance as the velocity profile adjusts to the drag profile. Modeling a kelp forest as an array of vertical cylinders underestimates the net drag by a factor of 1.5 to 3 if a substantial surface canopy is present. Turbulence is generated predominantly by small-scale shear in kelp wakes. Vertical mixing of scalars is expected to be significantly smaller than in the surrounding coastal ocean because of the combination of smaller turbulent eddies and reduced currents. The decrease in horizontal transport and vertical mixing within kelp forests may have important implications for nutrient availability to kelp forest organisms and may affect the dispersal or retention of their larvae and spores.},

	abstract = {The authors present a field study of estuarine turbulence in which profiles of Reynolds stresses were directly measured using an ADCP throughout a 25-h tidal day. The dataset that is discussed quantifies turbulent mixing for a water column in northern San Francisco Bay that experiences a sequence of states that includes a weak ebb and flood that are stratified, followed by a strong, and eventually unstratified, ebb and flood. These measurements show that energetic turbulence is confined to a bottom mixed layer by the overlying stratification. Examination of individual Reynolds stress profiles along with profiles of Richardson number and turbulent Froude number shows that the water column can be divided into regions based on the relative importance of buoyancy effects. Using the measured turbulence production rate P, the dissipation rate epsilon is estimated. The observed turbulence had values of epsilon/vN(2) {\textgreater} 20 all of the time and epsilon/vN(2) {\textgreater} 200 most of the time, suggesting that the observed motions were buoyancy affected turbulence rather than internal waves. However. at times, turbulent Froude numbers in much of the upper-water column were less than one, indicating important stratification effects. Taken as a whole, the data show that stratification affects the turbulent velocity variance q(2) most severely; that is, observed reductions in {\textless}(u'w')over bar{\textgreater} are largely associated with small values of q(2) rather than with a dramatic reduction in the efficiency with which turbulent motions produce momentum fluxes. Finally, the dataset is compared to predictions made using the popular Mellor-Yamada level 2.5 closure. These comparisons show that the model tends to underestimate the turbulent kinetic energy in regions of strong stratification where the turbulence is strongly inhomogeneous and to overestimate the turbulent kinetic energy in weakly stratified regions. The length scale does not appear to compensate for these errors, and. as a result, similar errors are seen in the eddy viscosity predictions. It is hypothesized that the underestimation of q(2) is due to an inaccurate parameterization of turbulence self-transport from the near-bed region to the overlying stratification.},

The conversion factors are tabulated for quick reference for the common empirical spectral shapes. The different spectral shapes considered are shown to exhibit similar spectral moment relationships. Using these relationships, uncertainty in Stokes drift may be decomposed into the uncertainty in spectral shape and a much greater uncertainty due to significant wave height and wave period discrepancies among ERA40/WAM, satellite altimetry, and CORE2 reanalysis-forced WAVEWATCH III simulations. Furthermore, using ERA40 or CORE2 winds and assuming fully-developed waves results in discrepancies that are unable to explain the discrepancies in modeled Stokes drift; the assumption of fully-developed waves is likely the culprit. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The circulation appears to control the transport of surface oil in deep waters and over most of the continental shelf. But as oil approaches shallow water the wave orientation may become more conducive than the circulation orientation for transporting oil to the beach. In essence it is found that the circulation gets the oil to the vicinity of the beach, whereas the waves, via Stokes drift, are responsible for the actual beaching of oil. A combination of observations and numerical model simulations are used to demonstrate this.},

	abstract = {The problem of wind-induced flow in inland waters is drawing significant research attention given its relevance to a plethora of applications in wetlands including treatment designs, pollution reduction, and biogeochemical cycling. The present work addresses the role of wind induced turbulence and waves within an otherwise static water body in the presence of rigid and flexible emergent vegetation through flume experimentation and time series analysis. Because no prior example of Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) experiments involving air-water and flexible oscillating components have been found in the literature, a spectral analysis framework is needed and proposed here to guide the analysis involving noise, wave and turbulence separation. The experiments reveal that wave and turbulence effects are simultaneously produced at the air-water interface and the nature of their coexistence is found to vary with different flow parameters including water level, mean wind speed, vegetation density and its flexibility. For deep water levels, signature of fine-scaled inertial turbulence is found at deeper layers of the water system. The wave action appears stronger close to the air-water interface and damped by the turbulence deeper inside the water system. As expected, wave action is found to be dominated in a certain frequency range driven by the wind forcing, while it is also diffused to lower frequencies by means of (wind-induced) oscillations in vegetation. Regarding the mean water velocity, existence of a counter-current flow and its switching to fully forward flow in the direction of the wind under certain combinations of flow parameters were studied. The relative importance of wave and turbulence to the overall energy, degree of anisotropy in the turbulent energy components, and turbulent momentum transport at different depths from the air-water interface and flow combinations were then quantified. The flume experiments reported here differ from previous laboratory studies in the related literature involving vegetation in the sense that the wave forcing is only present on the water surface contrary to a full-body excitation by tidal wave simulators and thus important in advancing the knowledge regarding a wider range of water resource problems.},

	abstract = {The Stokes drift, and its leading-order approximation, for a random sea depend upon the interaction of different wave groups and the process of wave spreading. Here Stokes drift direction and magnitude from prescribed spectra, local observational buoy data, and global model WAVEWATCH III output are used to analyze approximations of Stokes drift for directional random seas in deep water. To facilitate analysis, a new approximation is defined to incorporate the systematic effects of wave spreading. Stokes drift is typically overestimated by ignoring these effects or by ignoring directional differences in swell and wind seas. These two errors are differentiated and found to be largely uncorrelated. These errors depend strongly on depth, with deeper Stokes drift favoring narrow-banded swell and shallower Stokes drift favoring wind seas. Results are consistent among the data examined. Mean Stokes drift magnitude reductions from wave spreading and multidirectional wave effects alone are 14–20\% and 7–23\% respectively, giving a combined reduction of 20–40\% versus unidirectional waves, depending on wave age and depth. Approximations that do not include these reductions however, will on average overestimate Stokes drift by 16–26\%, 26–43\%, and 45–71\% respectively. In addition to magnitude, the direction of Stokes drift is also affected and multidirectional waves generate a directional veer with depth: the 30/60/90\% confidence intervals are bounded (approximately) by ± 0.12/0.28/0.84 radians ( ± 7/16/48 deg) at the surface, with smaller intervals at depth. Complementary depth-integrated approximations are also investigated and directional effects are similar with depth-dependent subsurface results. Furthermore, an optimized directional spread correction for the surface is nearly identical for global simulations and a buoy located at Ocean Weather Station P (50°N 145°W), and does not require directional wave spectrum data.},

Different concentration-backscattering models and calibration strategies were compared using two frequencies or only one and accounting or not for sound adsorption due to sediments. Two Teledyne RD Instruments (RDI) ADCPs, working at different frequencies (600 and 1200 kHz), were used simultaneously on the same water column to investigate the suspended sediment concentration and grain size distribution at four cross-sections of a lower Paraná River bifurcation near San Martín city (Argentina). In the same campaign, a Sontek 1000 kHz ADCP previously calibrated with water samples was also used. By applying a mixed electric-acoustical backscatter approach, each RDI ADCP was calibrated on an expected mean concentration, and a homogeneous grain size was fixed among the whole measurement field. Concerning the concentration results, the calibration on the mean value was found to be sufficiently reliable when compared to the previously tested and accepted acoustical backscatter method calibrated against an array of field samples that covered the concentration range of extrapolation. The same electric-acoustic approach was applied for the two frequency method. In this case, the backscatter was calibrated against the expected mean grain size and concentration. Preliminary results concerning the concentration and grain size distribution are consistent with the results of other methods. The quantity and texture of suspended sediments of the Paraná River were found to be consistent with instrument limits in terms of backscattering sensitivity. The wash load did not affect the sound propagation, and sound adsorption due to suspended sand did not perturb the sand concentration assessment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Previous numerical results for particles in a random flow field, where the flow dynamics were not considered, showed an increase in the average settling velocity. Direct numerical simulations of the motion of heavy particles in isotropic homogeneous turbulence have been performed where the flow dynamics are included. These show that a significant increase in the average settling velocity can occur for particles with inertial response time and still-fluid terminal velocity comparable to the Kolmogorov scales of the turbulence. This increase may be as much as 50\% of the terminal velocity, which is much larger than was previously found. The concentration field of the heavy particles, obtained from direct numerical simulations, shows the importance of the inertial bias with particles tending to collect in elongated sheets on the peripheries of local vortical structures. This is coupled then to a preferential sweeping of the particles in downward moving fluid. Again the importance of Kolmogorov scaling to these processes is demonstrated. Finally, some consideration is given to larger particles that are subject to a nonlinear drag force where it is found that the nonlinearity reduces the net increase in settling velocity.},

	abstract = {The marine boundary layer (MBL) is a dynamic region where the ocean is strongly coupled with the atmosphere. This coupling facilitates the exchange of momentum, mass, and heat at the air-sea interface through turbulent processes. In part, these exchanges impact the climate though driving currents, creating waves, triggering ocean mixing, influencing whitecap coverage, impacting aerosol production, and altering atmospheric and oceanic stability. The exchange of momentum and enthalpy at high wind speeds are also responsible for the genesis and dissipation of tropical cyclones and their cold wakes. However, there remains a lack of understanding about the MBL and the interaction between the air and the ocean, particularly at high wind speeds. This dissertation helps fill this knowledge gap by examining energy transfer and MBL turbulence using in situ data collected on floating instrument platforms in harsh conditions and at high wind speeds. Results are presented from two recent field campaigns: the Southern Ocean Gas Exchange Experiment (SOGasex) and the Impact of Typhoons on the Ocean in the Pacific (ITOP) experiment. ITOP data represent the first direct deep ocean measurements taken from a floating platform in typhoons. Mean wind speeds (1 min. sustained) reached 30m/s and significant wave heights above 11m were recorded. Data were analyzed using the eddy-covariance technique and parameterized in terms of the turbulent exchange coefficients for latent heat CE and momentum CD. Results show that CE is generally independent of wind speed. CD is found to have a linear dependence on wind speed up to {\textasciitilde}22m/s at which point it features a roll-off. It was found that this was due to a reduction in the downwind component of the momentum flux at the frequency of the peak waves. This occurred during strongly forced conditions when the wind and peak wave directions were closely aligned and significant wave height was very large. Environmental conditions surrounding the drag coefficient roll-off are inductive of some form of flow separation at the wave frequency. The possibility that the roll-off occurred because measurements were made in the wave boundary layer is also discussed. At moderate wind speeds CD is also found to be suppressed in the presence of swell. The evolution of the upper ocean determined from an array of subsurface temperature sensors is also presented. Results reveal a link between surface forcing to changes in sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, and depth averaged temperature. It was also found that, in some circumstances, cool water upwelled by typhoons was capped by a surface warm layer which masked the still present colder water below. It is noted that this capping represents a challenge when trying to describe the thermal structure of the ocean using surface temperature observations alone. Finally, ocean temperature was modeled using a 1-D mixed layer model. The model was able to determine the approximate timing of mixed layer temperature decrease associated with typhoon cold wake, but did not adequately model the magnitude of the temperature reductions or mixed layer depth changes. In periods of low to moderate wind speeds the model done a good job at capturing the magnitude of diurnal heating. However, under such conditions, the model was found to suffer from run-away foundation temperature due to insufficient nocturnal heat loss.},

Once created, these droplets accelerate to the local wind speed in 1 s or less and thereby extract momentum from the wind. Because these droplets have substantial mass, they eventually plunge back into the ocean, delivering their horizontal momentum to the surface in the form of a spray stress. Inadequate information on the production rate and size distribution of spray droplets, however, hampered previous attempts to estimate the magnitude of this spray-mediated momentum exchange. This paper therefore uses recent estimates of the spray generation function to reconsider spray's ability to alter air–sea momentum exchange. Conservation of momentum requires that spray cannot enhance the air– sea stress beyond what the large-scale flow dictates. However, spray can redistribute stress in the near-surface atmosphere since the wind must slow if the spray droplets accelerate. For a wind of 30 m s−1, spray supports about 10\% of the surfa...},

Free-ranging domestic cats have been introduced globally and have contributed to multiple wildlife extinctions on islands. The magnitude of mortality they cause in mainland areas remains speculative, with large-scale estimates based on non-systematic analyses and little consideration of scientific data. Here we conduct a systematic review and quantitatively estimate mortality caused by cats in the United States. We estimate that free-ranging domestic cats kill 1.4-3.7 billion birds and 6.9-20.7 billion mammals annually. Un-owned cats, as opposed to owned pets, cause the majority of this mortality. Our findings suggest that free-ranging cats cause substantially greater wildlife mortality than previously thought and are likely the single greatest source of anthropogenic mortality for US birds and mammals. Scientifically sound conservation and policy intervention is needed to reduce this impact.},

However, the presence of surface gravity waves can significantly bias stress estimates, limiting application of the technique in the coastal ocean. This work describes a new approach to estimate Reynolds stresses from ADCP velocities obtained in the presence of waves. The method fits an established semiempirical model of boundary layer turbulence to the measured turbulent cospectra at frequencies below those of surface gravity waves to estimate the stress. Applied to ADCP observations made in weakly stratified waters and variable significant wave heights, estimated near-bottom and near-surface stresses using this method compared well with independent estimates of the boundary stresses in contrast to previous methods. Additionally, the vertical structure of tidal stress estimated using the new approach matched that inferred from a linear momentum balance at stress levels below the estimated stress uncertainties. Because the method makes an estimate of the horizontal turbulent length scales present as part of the model fit, these results can also enable a direct correction for the mean bias errors resulting from instrument tilt, if these scales are long relative to the beam separation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Measurements of the vertical Reynolds stress components in the wave-dominated nearshore are required to diagnose momentum and turbulence dynamics. Removing wave bias from Reynolds stress estimates is critical to a successful diagnosis. Here two existing Reynolds stress estimation methods (those of Trowbridge, and Shaw and Trowbridge) for wave-dominated environments and an extended method (FW) that is a combination of the two are tested with a vertical array of three current meters deployed in 3.2-m water depth off an ocean beach. During the 175-h-long experiment the instruments were seaward of the surfzone and the alongshore current was wind driven. Intercomparison of Reynolds stress methods reveals that the Trowbridge method is wave bias dominated. Tests of the integrated cospectra are used to reject bad Reynolds stress estimates, and the Shaw and Trowbridge estimates are rejected more often than FW estimates. With the FW method, wave bias remains apparent in the cross-shore component of the Reynolds stress. However, the alongshore component of Reynolds stress measured at the three current meters are related to each other with a vertically uniform first EOF containing 73\% of the variance, indicating the presence of a constant stress layer. This is the first time the vertical structure of Reynolds stress has been measured in a wave-dominated environment. The Reynolds stress is, albeit weakly, related to the wind stress and a parameterized bottom stress. Using derived wave bias and bottom stress parameterizations, the effect of wave bias on Reynolds stress estimates is shown to be weaker for more typical surfzone conditions (with both stronger waves and currents than those observed here).},

Remote sensing instruments such as Doppler lidars provide wind speed data at many heights, which would be useful in determining wind loadings of tall buildings, and predicting local air quality. Studies comparing remote sensing with traditional anemometers carried out in flat, homogeneous terrain often use scan patterns which take several minutes. In an urban context the flow changes quickly in space and time, so faster scans are required to ensure little change in the flow over the scan period. We compare 3993h of wind speed data collected using a three-beam Doppler lidar wind profiling method with data from a sonic anemometer (190m). Both instruments are located in central London, UK; a highly built-up area. Based on wind profile measurements every 2min, the uncertainty in the hourly mean wind speed due to the sampling frequency is 0.05-0.11ms-1. The lidar tended to overestimate the wind speed by ???0.5ms-1 for wind speeds below 20ms-1. Accuracy may be improved by increasing the scanning frequency of the lidar. This method is considered suitable for use in urban areas. ???There is a need for more wind speed data collected above rooftop level in cities.???Remote sensing instruments can measure throughout the boundary layer.???Rapid evolution of the flow above cities means a short scan time is needed.???Data using a 3-beam Doppler lidar profiling method was compared with an anemometer.???The 3-beam method was found to be suitable for use in urban areas. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

Recent advances in instrumentation and analysis, however, have permitted the analysis of turbulent using characteristics of large-scale motions, specifically Reynolds stresses, shear production, and turbulent kinetic energy itself. In this paper, an analysis technique for use with acoustic Doppler current profiler data is presented that uses the third moments of the velocity measurements to estimate the nonlocal diffusive transport of the turbulent kinetic energy. Following the development of this analysis, a formal error analysis is presented to quantify the uncertainty associated with these estimates. Finally, the analysis is demonstrated using a dataset collected in San Francisco Bay. The results are consistent with both the expected structure of the transport terms and other measurements of the diffusive flux collected simultaneously. It is concluded that the analysis technique provides a reasonable estimate of the turbulent transport term in the turbulent kinetic energy equation, but requires care in the application due to the large uncertainty associated with the estimate.},

In estuaries with relatively strong tidal forcing and modest buoyancy forcing, the tidal variation in stratification leads to a tidal straining circulation driven by tidal variation in vertical mixing, with a magnitude that may significantly exceed the gravitational circulation. For weakly stratified estuaries, vertical and lateral advection are also important contributors to the tidally driven residual circulation. The apparent contradiction with the conventional paradigm is resolved when the estuarine parameter space is mapped with respect to a mixing parameter M that is based on the ratio of the tidal timescale to the vertical mixing timescale. Estuaries with high M values exhibit strong tidal nonlinearity, and those with small M values show conventional estuarine dynamics. Estuaries with intermediate mixing rates show marked transitions between these regimes at timescales of the springneap cycle.},

The present paper compares a unique wind-data series from an ocean mooring with two re-analysis products and data from six over-land sites in Sydney, Australia, to determine whether these data can infer over-ocean wind conditions. Four oceanographic moorings are located here; however, over-ocean meteorological observations are no longer available. Correlations between over-ocean and over-land sites wind stress were {\textgreater}0.8, whereas for re-analysis products, correlations ranged from 0.28 to 0.72. Re-analysis products were unable to resolve variability at the over-ocean site with periods shorter than 2 days, indicating that they are not appropriate wind proxies for the coastal ocean. Somewhat counter-intuitively, our results showed that proximity of over-land sites to the over-ocean site does not necessarily imply the highest correlation or the lowest error and careful site selection is required. An upwelling study showed that wind observations from selected over-land sites can accurately represent isotherm uplift in the coastal ocean. Threshold wind stress values that uplift isotherms at these over-land sites are provided, along with a recommendation for the use of the over-land site that best represents over-ocean wind conditions in this region.},

Pressure transducers filter the nonlinear components of the signal in complicated ways. Wave staffs have varying degrees of sensitivity to spray. The location of the instruments also plays an important role. There is clear evidence from measurements in the North Sea that spurious crests due to spray are a problem downwind even from mounting supports that appear transparent.

Major features of the observed flow adjustment are not included in the theory of internal boundary layers.

With flow from warm water over cooler water, substantial turbulence intermittently develops above the newly formed surface inversion layer. The corresponding, spatially-averaged, downward momentum flux is stronger than that close to the surface. With stably stratified flow over modest increases of sea-surface temperature, a reduction of stratification can trigger episodic shear generation of turbulence. In these cases, the primary role of increasing surface temperature in the downwind direction is to induce shear generation of turbulence. With larger increases of surface temperature, upward heat flux generates turbulence, warms the air and generates a significant horizontal gradient of hydrostatic pressure. This contribution to the pressure field appears to strongly modify the flow. Major inadequacies in existing data and future needs are noted.},

However, traditional bulk algorithms predict a monotonic decrease in this ratio with increasing wind speed, giving a value of less than 0.5 under tropical cyclone conditions. The present model describes a decrease in the ratio with increasing wind speed under weak to moderate winds ({\textless}20 m s−1), and a plateau at approximately 0.7 under strong winds ({\textgreater}20 m s−1).},

	abstract = {A numerical simulation of circulation in the Columbia River estuary and plume during the summer of 2004 is used to explore the mixing involved as river water is transformed into shelf water. The model is forced with realistic river flow, tides, wind stress, surface heat flux, and ocean boundary conditions. Simulated currents and water properties on the shelf near the mouth are compared with records from three moorings (all in 72 m of water) and five CTD sections. The model is found to have reasonable skill; statistically significant correlations between observed and modeled surface currents, temperature, and salinity are all 0.42-0.72 for the mooring records. Equations for the tidally averaged, volume-integrated mechanical energy budget (kinetic and potential) are derived, with attention to the effects of: (i) Reynolds averaging, (ii) a time varying volume due to the free surface, and (iii) dissipation very close to the bottom. It is found that convergence of tidal pressure work is the most important forcing term in the estuary. In the far field plume (which has a volume 15 times greater than that of the estuary), the net forcing is weaker than that in the estuary, and may be due to either tidal currents or wind stress depending on the time period considered. These forcings lead to irreversible mixing of the stratification (buoyancy flux) that turns river water into shelf water. This occurs in both the plume and estuary, but appears to be more efficient (17\% vs. 5\%), and somewhat greater (4.2 MW vs. 3.3 MW), in plume vs. estuary. This demonstrates the importance of both wind and tidal forcing to watermass transformation, and the need to consider the estuary and plume as part of a single system. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {A field experiment was conducted to directly compare the effects of different sampling modes on Reynolds stress estimates calculated from acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). Two 1.2-MHz ADCPs were deployed concurrently over a fortnightly cycle: one collected single-ping measurements using mode 1 and a second ADCP employed the fast-ping rate mode 12 with subping-averaged data recorded at the same sample rate as the first ADCP. While mode 12 clearly has a lower noise floor for the estimate of mean velocities, it has been an open question whether the averaging of subpings leads to a biased estimate of turbulence quantities, due to the temporal averaging inherent in this approach. Using the variance method, Reynolds stresses were estimated from the two ADCP datasets and compared with stresses computed directly from the velocity records obtained with a pair of fast sampling acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs) collocated with the ADCPs. Mode-12 stresses were more accurate than mode 1 in comparison to ADV-derived stresses, and mode 12 exhibited much lower measurement uncertainty than mode 1. Mode 1 appears to overestimate stresses by 20\% in this study. The lower noise floor associated with mode 12 suggests that the variance method may be used with mode 12 to resolve smaller stresses than would be possible with mode 1.},

	abstract = {A method for conducting leeway field experiments to establish the drift properties of small objects (0.1-25 m) is described. The objective is to define a standardized and unambiguous procedure for condensing the drift properties down to a set of coefficients that may be incorporated into existing stochastic trajectory forecast models for drifting objects of concern to search and rescue operations and other activities involving vessels lost at sea such as containers with hazardous material. An operational definition of the slip or wind and wave-induced motion of a drifting object relative to the ambient current is proposed. This definition taken together with a strict adherence to a 10 m wind speed allows us to refer unambiguously to the leeway of a drifting object. We recommend that all objects if possible be studied using what we term the direct method, where the object's leeway is studied directly using an attached current meter. We establish a minimum set of parameters that should be estimated for a drifting object for it to be included in the operational forecast models used for prediction of search areas for drifting objects. We divide drifting objects into four categories, depending on their size. For the smaller objects (less than 0.5 m), an indirect method of measuring the object's motion relative to the ambient current must be used. For larger objects, direct measurement of the motion through the near-surface water masses is strongly recommended. Larger objects are categorized according to the ability to attach current meters and wind monitoring systems to them. The leeway field method proposed here is illustrated with results from field work where three objects were studied in their distress configuration; a 1:3.3 sized model of a 40-foot Shipping container, a World War II mine and a 220 l (55-gallon) oil drum. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Surface waves introduce velocity correlations that bias and often dominate Reynolds stress estimates made using the traditional variance method for acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). This analysis shows that the wave bias is the sum of a real wave stress and an error due to instrument tilt, both of which have a large uncertainty. Three alternative extensions to the variance method for calculating Reynolds stress profiles from ADCP measurements in wavy conditions are analyzed. The previously proposed variance fitting method (Variance Fit) is evaluated and two more general methods that use along- and between-beam velocity differencing with adaptive filtering (Vertical AF and Horizontal AF) are derived. The three methods are tested on datasets containing long-period monochromatic swell (Moorea, French Polynesia) and shorter-period mixed swell (Santa Barbara, California). The Variance Fit method leaves a residual wave bias in beam velocity variances, especially for intermediate waves, but gives physically reasonable Reynolds stress estimates because most of the residual wave bias cancels when the variance method is applied. The new Vertical AF method does not produce inherent wave bias in beam velocity variances, but yields comparable Reynolds stresses to the Variance Fit method. The Horizontal AF method performs poorly for all but monochromatic waves. Error remaining after one of the above methods is applied can be attributed to residual wave error, correlation of turbulence between points chosen for differencing, or correlation between waves and turbulence. A simple procedure is provided for determining the minimum bin separation that can be used.},

The most commonly used formulations of the aerodynamic roughness length, required by similarity theory, are examined using data sets from four different field programs. These relationships include the Charnock formulation and the wave age modified Charnock relationship. The goal is to assess the overall performance of simple formulations of the roughness length including cases where the Charnock formulation is not expected to apply, and to assess the errors resulting from application of the Charnock formulation to all conditions, as is done in many numerical models where an explicit wave model cannot be accommodated. This examination indicates that spurious self-correlation explains more variance than actual physical relationships, even after eliminating weak wind cases. Frequent cases of anomalously low stress and very small values of the Charnock coefficient further reduce the usefulness of this formulation for the present data sets. Causes of the frequent very small values of the Charnock coefficient are briefly investigated.},

The model, implemented using Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), includes variable wind and atmospheric forcing, variable Columbia river flow, realistic boundary conditions from Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM), and 10 tidal constituents. Model skill has been demonstrated in detail elsewhere [MacCready, P., Banas, N.S., Hickey, B.M., Dever, E.P., Liu, Y., 2008. A model study of tide- and wind-induced mixing in the Columbia River estuary and plume. Continental Shelf Research, this issue, doi:10.1016/j.csr.2008.03.015]. Particles were released in the Columbia estuary, along the Washington coastal wall, and along the model's northern boundary at 48??N. Particles were tracked in three dimensions, using both velocities from ROMS and a vertical random displacement representing turbulent mixing. When 25 h of upwelling flow is looped and particles tracked for 12 d, their trajectories highlight a field of transient eddies and recirculations on scales from 5 to 50 km both north and south of the Columbia. Not all of these features are caused by plume dynamics, but the presence of the plume increases the entrainment of inner-shelf water into them. The cumulative effect of the plume's interaction with these transient features is to increase cross-shelf dispersion: 25\% more water is transported laterally past the 100 m isobath when river and estuarine effects are included than when they are omitted. This cross-shelf dispersion also disrupts the southward transport of water along the inner shelf that occurs in the model when the Columbia River is omitted. This second effect-increased retention of upwelled water on the Washington shelf-may be partly responsible for the regional-scale alongcoast gradient in chlorophyll biomass, although variations in shelf width, the Juan de Fuca Eddy to the north, and the intermittency of upwelling-favorable winds are likely also to play important roles. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

There is evidence of significant and coherent signals of vertical velocity ∼2–3 mm s-1 and vertical heat (temperature) transport ∼10-3 °C m s-1 during the presence of three anticyclones. A simple analysis shows downward flow near the eddies’ centers above 350 m and essentially upward flow in the peripheries, but below 700-m depth the pattern is indeed the opposite; however, further study is necessary to determine the eddies’ interior structures. The observations also suggest the existence of a vertical convergence of heat somewhere around 600-m depth, and estimations of adiabatic heat flux suggest that part of the converged heat, which is not recirculated within the eddy, must escape from the eddy and flow upward along the isopycnals up to the surface layers. This is in good agreement with previous results that have suggested that an excess heat gained by the Gulf in the intermediate levels through exchanges with the Caribbean Sea must be exported to the upper layers by an upward mean heat flux.

	abstract = {Acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) have been used to measure Reynolds stresses in tidally dominated environments where wave action was minimal. In this paper, we examine observations from a microtidal estuary where the effects of wind stress and surface waves dominate the velocity variance. Reynolds stress measurements in this setting require a technique for addressing surface gravity wave contamination. We present here a method of reducing the effect of wave motion on Reynolds stresses by subtracting coincident observations along the axis of the ADCP beam. Linear wave theory is used to account for the attenuation of wave orbital velocities with depth. Using this method, Reynolds stress values are brought in line with those predicted by drag laws at the surface and bottom. The apparent Reynolds stress that is removed by the along-axis subtraction is shown to be largely due to the interaction of a slight tilt (1°) in the ADCP and the wave orbital velocity. During periods of stronger wind and waves, there is evidence of enhanced near-surface turbulence and momentum flux, presumably due to breaking waves. During these events, our calculated Reynolds stress magnitudes still appear reasonable, although the directions are suspect. We develop a diagnostic technique that clearly demarcates this region when it occurs. Coincident density profile measurements are used with the ADCP data to compute gradient Richardson numbers throughout the water column. Enhanced Reynolds stresses appear to correspond to Richardson numbers less than one.},

	abstract = {Directional energy spectra of nearshore surface waves were measured for a 3-year period (2004-2007) at a site with mean depth 14 m and mean tidal range 2.1 m. Triaxys surface-following wave buoys reported hourly directional wave energy spectra and wave parameters near the offshore end of the Savannah River Entrance Channel, Georgia, USA. An acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) was located beside the wave buoy for 3 months. Directional and non-directional surface wave energy spectra and the corresponding bulk wave parameters (height, period, and direction) are compared for the two systems. Most parameters derived from the spectra agree closely; the most significant differences were found at the upper and lower frequency measurement limits, where signal-to-noise ratios were lower. The wave buoy consistently reports a small amount of energy below 0.05 Hz that does not appear in the ADCP-derived spectra and does not appear to be related to the mooring system. This leads to larger mean and peak periods reported by the buoy. All directional spectra were computed using the Maximum Entropy Method for both instruments, but the buoy, with spectra derived from six independent time series, provides lower directional resolving power than the ADCP, which utilizes twelve time series. Both systems gave similar results defining mean and peak wave directions, with the primary difference being that the ADCP indicates energy to be more tightly concentrated around the peak direction. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected from a moored buoy over 3 months during the 2010 Pacific typhoon season. During this period, three typhoons and a tropical storm were encountered. Maximum 30-min sustained wind speeds above 26 ms-1 were recorded. Data are presented for 1245 h of direct flux measurements. The drag coefficient shows evidence of a rolloff at wind speeds greater than 22 ms-1, which occurred during the passage of a single typhoon. This result is in agreement with other studies but occurs at a lower wind speed than previously measured. The authors conclude that this rolloff was caused by a reduction in the turbulent momentum flux at the frequency of the peak waves during strongly forced conditions.},

The turbulent dissipation rate ϵ, estimated on a 160-m-long cross-shore instrumented array, was an order of magnitude larger within the surf zone relative to seaward of the surf zone. The observed ϵ covaried across the array with changing incident wave height, tide level, and alongshore current. The cross-shore-integrated depth times ϵ was correlated with, but was only 1\% of, the incident wave energy flux, indicating that surf-zone water-column turbulence is driven directly (turbulence injected by wave breaking) or indirectly (by forcing alongshore currents) by waves and that the bulk of ϵ occurs in the upper water column. This small fraction is consistent with laboratory studies. The surf-zone-scaled (or Froude-scaled) ϵ is similar to previous field observations, albeit somewhat smaller than laboratory observations. A breaking-wave ϵ scaling is applicable in the midwater column at certain locations, indicating a vertical diffusion of turbulence and ϵ balance. However, observations at different cross-shore locations do not collapse, which is consistent with a cross-shore lag between wave energy gradients and the surface turbulence flux. With strong alongshore currents, a BBL-scaled ϵ indicates that shear production is a significant turbulence source within the surf zone, particularly in the lower water column. Similarly for large currents at one location, the dissipation to shear production ratio approaches one. Both dissipation scalings depend upon wave energy flux gradients. The ratio of BBL to SBL ϵ has complex dependencies but is larger for a deeper part of the surf zone and more obliquely incident waves.},

	abstract = {Two dams on the Elwha River, Washington State, USA trapped over 20millionm3 of mud, sand, and gravel since 1927, reducing downstream sediment fluxes and contributing to erosion of the river's coastal delta. The removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams, initiated in September 2011, induced massive increases in river sediment supply and provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine the geomorphic response of a coastal delta to these increases. Detailed measurements of beach topography and nearshore bathymetry show that {\textasciitilde}2.5millionm3 of sediment was deposited during the first two years of dam removal, which is {\textasciitilde}100 times greater than deposition rates measured prior to dam removal. The majority of the deposit was located in the intertidal and shallow subtidal region immediately offshore of the river mouth and was composed of sand and gravel. Additional areas of deposition include a secondary sandy deposit to the east of the river mouth and a muddy deposit west of the mouth. A comparison with fluvial sediment fluxes suggests that {\textasciitilde}70\% of the sand and gravel and {\textasciitilde}6\% of the mud supplied by the river was found in the survey area (within about 2km of the mouth). A hydrodynamic and sediment transport model, validated with in-situ measurements, shows that tidal currents interacting with the larger relict submarine delta help disperse fine sediment large distances east and west of the river mouth. The model also suggests that waves and currents erode the primary deposit located near the river mouth and transport sandy sediment eastward to form the secondary deposit. Though most of the substrate of the larger relict submarine delta was unchanged during the first two years of dam removal, portions of the seafloor close to the river mouth became finer, modifying habitats for biological communities. These results show that river restoration, like natural changes in river sediment supply, can result in rapid and substantial coastal geomorphological responses.},

Direct flux measurements are additionally affected by the angular velocity of the platform. The classic approach is to first correct the wind speed for angular and translational platform velocities and thereafter rotate the wind vector into the mean flow. We find that for ships under way, this leads to an over-estimation of the vector tilt and biased flux estimates. This may explain the common observation that flux estimates from ships in transit have lower quality than measurements taken on station. Here we present an alternative approach where the flow distortion-induced tilt of the wind vector is estimated from the 3D-wind speed measurements and applied to the apparent wind vector. The tilt correction is carried out after correction for the platform angular velocity, but before removing the ship’s mean t...},

The curl of the wind stress was calculated from directly measured turbulent stress components. The accuracy of the computed curl was estimated to be adequate to map the spatial structure. Wintertime measurements showed a concentration of large positive curl [over 1 Pa / 100 km] west of Point Arena, regardless of wind direction, due to the effects of the coastal topography on the wind fields. Results from summertime measurements showed a similar local maximum of positive curl west of Point Arena. Larger curl values [over 3.5 Pa / 100 km], however, were observed across a hydraulic jump propagating from Stewarts Point for highly supercritical marine boundary-layer flow. A two-layer, vertically integrated numerical model of coastal upwelling was used to assess the relative importance of the stress curl to the stress-driven transport. The nonzero stress curl altered the thickness of the upper layer considerably after a day of integration, expanding the horizontal extent of upwelling offshore. The greatest effects were around areas of high positive curl, increasing coastal upwelling for downcoast winds and decreasing downwelling for upcoast winds. The effect of the stress curl, however, was attenuated near the coast as compared to the maximum possible deep water values. The validity of the numerical model was verified by comparison with an analytical solution of a simplified set of one-dimensional, frictionless equations of motion.},

In this study, the FB instrumentation and data analysis techniques are described, and the data collected during two U.S. east coast buoy deployments are used to examine the impact of atmospheric and surface wave properties on air-sea momentum transfer in coastal ocean regions. Data obtained off Duck, North Carolina, clearly show that, for a given wind speed, neutral drag coefficients in offshore winds are higher than those in onshore winds. Offshore wind drag coefficients observed over the wind speed range from 5 to 21 m s1 were modeled equally well by a linear regression on wind speed, and a Charnock model with a constant of 0.016. Measurements from an FB deployment off Wallops Island, Virginia, show that neutral drag coefficients in onshore winds increase as the wind-wave direction differences increase, especially beyond ±60°.},

During offshore winds, the surface outflow is enhanced, freshwater is flushed out of the estuary, and the along-estuary salinity gradient becomes weak. Constrictions block the wind-induced flushing, resulting in strong salinity fronts across the constrictions. The residence time of one of the estuaries varies by more than a factor of three in response to variations in wind-induced flushing. The other estuary has little variation of flushing associated with winds, due to a constriction at the mouth that inhibits the wind-induced exchange. The strong influence of winds on the flushing of these estuaries is due in part to their shallow depths, which accentuates the influence of wind stress relative to the effects of the horizontal density gradient. In addition, the residence times of the estuaries are comparable to the time scale of wind forcing, allowing large changes in water properties during wind events.},

The transitions of the current boundary layer to various regimes appear to lag behind, or to occur a t a higher wind velocity than, those of the airflow. The fraction of the wind stress supported by the wave drag seems to vary with the wind and wave conditions: a large fraction is obtained at low wind velocities with shorter waves and a small fraction is obtained a t high wind velocities with longer waves. At the air-water interface, the wind-induced current is found to be proportional to the friction velocity of the wind. The Stokes mass transport, related to wave characteristics, is only a small component of the surface drift in laboratory tanks.

Numerous invertebrates and some fish species are typically found associated with drift algal clumps and aggregations. Transport of drift algae is an important dispersal mechanism for both the plants and their associated fauna. Dispersal distances have been studied in numerous locations over a range of spatial scales. However, little is known about quantities of algal material that are involved.

Sargassum (a brown alga) and about 12 genera of red algae were found in three seasonal collections (Aug., Dec., May). Total biomass collected varied among seasons, with larger average amounts of drift algae collected in May than the other two months sampled. From this data, I calculate the approximate quantities of drift algae that are potentially moving in, or out of, Biscayne Bay, about a half to one ton of biomass per day. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. In case of oil spills due to disasters, one of the environmental concerns is the oil trajectories and spatial distribution. To meet these new challenges, spill response plans need to be upgraded. An important component of such a plan would be models able to simulate the behaviour of oil in terms of trajectories and spatial distribution, if accidentally released, in deep water. All these models need to be calibrated with independent observations. The aim of the present paper is to demonstrate that significant support to oil slick monitoring can be obtained by the synergistic use of oil drift models and remote sensing observations. Based on transport properties and weathering processes, oil drift models can indeed predict the fate of spilled oil under the action of water current velocity and wind in terms of oil position, concentration and thickness distribution. The oil spill event that occurred on 31 May 2003 in the Baltic Sea offshore the Swedish and Danish coasts is considered a case study with the aim of producing three-dimensional models of sea circulation and oil contaminant transport. The High-Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) is used for atmospheric forcing. The results of the numerical modelling of current speed and water surface elevation data are validated by measurements carried out in Kalmarsund, Simrishamn and Kungsholmsfort stations over a period of 18 days and 17 h. The oil spill model uses the current field obtained from a circulation model. Near-infrared (NIR) satellite images were compared with numerical simulations. The simulation was able to pr edict both the oil spill trajectories of the observed slick and thickness distribution. Therefore, this work shows how oil drift modelling and remotely sensed data can provide the right synergy to reproduce the timing and transport of the oil and to get reliable estimates of thicknesses of spilled oil to prepare an emergency plan and to assess the magnitude of risk involved in case of oil spills due to disaster.},

Complex and real linear regression models are used to estimate the relative slip of undrogued SVP drifters and to extract the wind-driven currents from the drifter velocities. The frequency response of the wind-driven currents is studied using cross-spectral analysis. By comparing the velocities of cotemporal and nearly collocated undrogued and drogued SVP drifters, it appears that undrogued SVP drifters have a general downwind slippage of about 1\% of the wind speed. Time-lagged complex correlations and cross-spectral results show that the wind response is almost simultaneous. The velocities of SVP drifters drogued to 15 m are poorly correlated with the winds (R2 ≈ 3\%): wind-driven currents have a magnitude of 0.7\% of the wind speed and are 27°–42° to the right of the wind.

We found that spatial variations in coral cover were correlated with temperature variations on time scales of days to weeks. Shallow terrace and backreef sites with high coral cover ({\textgreater} 50\%) had a highly variable temperature distribu- tions, but their average weekly temperature distributions were lower and similar to offshore waters. The mechanism for maintaining this low weekly temperature was mean advection, which varied on a weekly timescale in response to wave forcing. Tides were also important in driving flow on the atoll, but their contri- bution to the net transport of heat was not significant. Wind and regional forcing were generally not impor- tant in driving flow inside the atoll. Buoyancy-driven flows were important within the lagoons, and in driving cross-shore exchange on forereef environments. The physical factors favoring high coral cover per- centage varied according to the different prevailing hydrodynamic regimes: low temperatures in backreef habitats, short travel times in lagoon habitats (days since entering the reef system), and lower wave stress on forereef habitats. In light of future warming from climate change, local areas of reefs which maintain lower temperatures through wave-driven mean flows will have the best likelihood of promoting coral survival.},

	title = {Equipment in {Support} for {Polarimetric} {Imaging}},
	abstract = {APPROACH The Polarimetric Slope Sensing (PSS) concept exploits the scattering properties of light from the air-water boundary to recover the instantaneous two-dimensional slope field of a water surface. Using two cameras, an up-looking wide field-of-view camera that measures the polarimetric properties of the sky radiance, and a down-looking narrow field-of-view camera that measures the polarimetric properties of the reflected sky radiance it is possible to recover the 2-D surface slope of the water surface at every surface facet within the field-of-view of the camera viewing the water surface. By employing the physics of light scattering from a specular surface, the geometry of surface facets can be found by carefully measuring the polarimetric properties of the source and reflected and/or refracted light. Formally, Stokes proved in the nineteenth century that the polarization state of a bundle of light rays is fully described by the four-component Stokes vector S = (I,Q,U,V). The first component I measures the intensity of the light. The components Q and U measure the degree of linear polarization, and the fourth component V specifies the degree of circular polarization. This last component is crucial to fully determining the polarization state of a light since, in general, a ray will be elliptically polarized which needs to be decomposed into a linear and a circular polarization vector. The reflection and refraction of light at a specular surface is described by the Mueller calculus which states the Stokes vectors of the input and scattered rays (Sin and Sout) are related by Sout = MSin, where M is the Mueller matrix. The direction of the rays, the dielectric properties of the air and water, and the Mueller matrix contain all of the information about the scattering (reflection and refraction from the air-water interface). Thus, by measuring the components Sin and Sout as well as the direction of the source and scattered rays, the orientation of the surface facet can be computed. At the heart of the system is a polarimetric camera that takes four component images, where the components correspond to the I,Q,U,V elements of the Stokes vector. A polarimetric camera is similar to a three-component R,G,B color camera, except that four components instead of three are taken, and the components correspond to the elements of the Stokes vector instead of color.},

For the simulation, the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model and Automatic Weather System (AWS) were used to generate tidal and wind fields respectively. Simulation results were then compared with 5 sets of spaceborne optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. From the present study, it was found that highest matching rate between the simulation results and satellite imagery was obtained with different values of the wind drift factor, and to first order, this factor was linearly proportional to the wind speed.

Particularly, Bragg resonance is the primary mechanism of radar backscatter from the ocean surface and the radar serves as a spectrometer of short surface waves. The roughness spectra inverted from radar backscatter measurements expand the short-wave database to high wind conditions in which in situ sensors do not function well. Using scatterometer geophysical model functions for L-, C-, and Ku-band microwave frequencies, the inverted roughness spectra, covering Bragg resonance wavelengths from 0.012 to 0.20 m, show a convergent trend in high winds.

	abstract = {Many tidal phenomena, including river tides, estuarine currents, and shelf and fjord internal tides, are non-stationary. These tidal processes are poorly understood and largely beyond the realm of practical prediction, even when the perturbing phenomenon causing the non-stationary behavior is itself fairly predictable. Our inadequate understanding of these phenomena has been exacerbated by an absence of a self-consistent procedure for analysis of the entire spectrum of non-stationary motions, tidal and non-tidal. The most difficult methodological situation occurs when the disturbing non-tidal signal is stronger than the tidal one and has an event-like character. Such sharp changes in forcing are multi-scale, containing energy at tidal frequencies, as well as at larger sales. Because of the distinct response of different parts of the tidal spectrum to non-tidal perturbations, multi-scale forcing events have the potential to provide a valuable new generation of tests of tidal dynamics models. This paper compares three techniques for the analysis of such signals, using artificial tidal records of known frequency content to ascertain which method most accurately represents evolving frequency content. The methods are: (a) conventional least-squares, short-term harmonic analysis (STHA); (b) a modified STHA (or mSTHA) that uses a smoothing window and augments the frequency structure of the analysis wave; and (c) linear convolution analysis in the form of continuous wavelet transforms (CWT). Results show that STHA and mSTHA lack a definable frequency response and mix energy between tidal and non-tidal signals in an unpredictable manner. STHA also effectively imposes a boxcar window on the data, the effects of which can be serve for short records. In general, STHA and mSTHA results using short windows will be least reliable in the circumstances where short windows are most desired - when the signal is highly non-stationary. There is, moreover, no simple way to set a minimum window length for STHA/mSTHA that will produce stable results, except to make the window too long to capture the fluctuating variance being sought. In contrast, CWT correctly recovers both tidal and non-tidal variance, as long as resolution limits set by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle are respected. Whatever method is chosen, use of window lengths less than {\textasciitilde}4-6 d requires great care, unless diurnal and subtidal energy are insignificant.},

These measurements are corrected for radar antenna pattern and geometry of observations. The resulting normalized radar cross section (NRCS) is parameterized in a form of truncated azimuthal Fourier series with coefficients dependent on the incidence angle and wind speed. This dual PP empirical model (KaDPMod) is consistent with the Ku-band NSCAT-4 model. However, some remarkable differences are revealed. They are apparent when analyzed using a decomposition of VV and HH measurements into polarized Bragg backscattering (polarization difference, PD = VV-HH) and nonpolarized (NP) backscattering from breaking waves. The polarization difference (PD) has strong azimuth and wind dependencies, with the wind exponent ranging from 2.5 to 3. The saturation wave spectra derived from multifrequency PD (based on KaDPMod and Ku- and C-band empirical models) have a notable peak in the capillary-gravity range. The relative contribution of NP radar return to the Ka-band NRCS is significant. In the upwind direction, it reaches up to 60\%-80\% and 25\%-50\% for HH and VV, respectively. It is found that the NP wind exponent is lower than that for Bragg backscattering. Therefore, the relative contribution of the NP to Ka-band NRCS decreases with increasing wind speed at both polarizations. Such a behavior is the opposite of that observed in the Ku-band.},

	abstract = {The spatial spectrum of short sea waves is locally modulated by the presence of longer waves or currents; in the remote sensing literature, this process is described by the hydrodynamic modulation transfer function (HMTF). Such modulations are important in understanding radar images of sea waves with water wavelengths longer than the radar range resolution. Existing models for the HMTF utilized in remote sensing are based on approximations derived from consideration of conservation of wave action. However, the accuracy of these approximations has been quantified only through comparison with experimental data; in such comparisons, numerous empirical models for terms such as wind forcing and breaking wave dissipation are required, which make direct evaluation of the hydrodynamic effects difficult. A method for providing direct insight into the hydrodynamic modulation of short sea waves by longer waves is described in this paper, through use of numerical nonlinear hydrodynamic codes for sea surface evolution. The codes applied are reviewed, and a Monte Carlo simulation process based on a stochastic spectrum of short waves propagating over a single deterministic long wave is described, including the data analysis techniques developed to extract a numerical HMTF from the simulated surfaces. HMTF values obtained from the simulations are compared with those from a first-order wave action solution and are found to be in reasonable agreement, although differences on the order of 10\% are observed. A numerical evaluation of long wave effects on the short wave dispersion relation is also provided},

Observations suggest that emulsified surface oil will drift down wind at speeds in excess of 3\% of the windspeed.

	abstract = {Turbulent Reynolds stresses are now routinely estimated from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements in estuaries and tidal channels using the variance method, yet biases due to surface gravity waves limit its use in the coastal ocean. Recent modifications to this method, including spatially filtering velocities to isolate the turbulence from wave velocities and fitting a cospectral model to the below-wave band cospectra, have been used to remove this bias. Individually, each modification performed well for the published test datasets, but a comparative analysis over the range of conditions in the coastal ocean has not yet been performed. This work uses ADCP velocity measurements from five previously published coastal ocean and estuarine datasets, which span a range of wave and current conditions as well as instrument configurations, to directly compare methods for estimating stresses in the presence of waves. The computed stresses from each were compared to bottom stress estimates from a quadratic drag law and, where available, estimates of wind stress. These comparisons, along with an analysis of the cospectra, indicated that spectral fitting performs well when the wave climate is wide-banded and/or multidirectional as well as when instrument noise is high. In contrast, spatial filtering performs better when waves are narrow-banded, low frequency, and when wave orbital velocities are strong relative to currents. However, as spatial filtering uses vertically separated velocity bins to remove the wave bias, spectral fitting is able to resolve stresses over a larger fraction of the water column. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

In this study, our main objective is to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of large eddy simulation (LES) as a possible tool to study small-scale oceanic processes. To this end, LES is evaluated in a 3D lock-exchange problem, which contains shear-driven mixing, internal waves, interactions with boundaries and convective motions, while having a simple domain, initial and boundary conditions, and forcing. Two general classes of LES models are tested, namely eddy viscosity (EV) models based on constant-coefficient and dynamic Smagorinsky models, and an approximate deconvolution (AD) model. By noting that the dynamic Smagorinsky and AD models have different strengths in that the former is good in providing appropriate dissipation while the latter in preserving the detail of coherent structures on coarse resolution meshes, a hybrid approach combining EV and AD models is also evaluated. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed as the benchmark solution, and all LES models are tested on three coarse meshes. The main measure of mixing is taken as the temporal evolution of background potential energy. It is found that constant-coefficient Smagorinsky models can only provide a marginal improvement over under-resolved simulations, while both dynamic Smagorinsky and AD models lead to significant improvements in mixing accuracy. The primary accomplishment of this study is that it is shown that the hybrid approach attains the best agreement with the mixing curve from DNS, while being computationally approximately a thousand times faster. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Microphysical theory has proven essential for explaining sea spray's role in transferring heat and moisture across the air-sea interface. But large-scale models of air-sea interaction, among other applications, cannot afford full microphysical modules for computing spray droplet evolution and, thus, how rapidly these droplets exchange heat and moisture with their environment. Fortunately, because the temperature and radius of saline droplets evolve almost exponentially when properly scaled, it is possible to approximate a droplet's evolution with just four microphysical endpoints: its equilibrium temperature, Teq; the e-folding time to reach that temperature, ??T; its equilibrium radius, req; and the e-folding time to reach that radius, ??r. Starting with microphysical theory, this paper derives quick approximation formulas for these microphysical quantities. These approximations are capable of treating saline droplets with initial radii between 0.5 and 500 ??m that evolve under the following ambient conditions: initial droplet temperatures and air temperatures between 0 and 40 ??C, ambient relative humidities between 75\% and 99.5\%, and initial droplet salinities between 1 and 40 psu. Estimating Teq, ??T, and ??r requires only one-step calculations; finding req is done recursively using Newton's method. The approximations for Teq and ??T are quite good when compared to similar quantities derived from a full microphysical model; Teq is accurate to within 0.02 ??C, and ??T is typically accurate to within 5\%. The estimate for equilibrium radius req is also usually within 5\% of the radius simulated with the full microphysical model. Finally, the estimate of radius e-folding time ??r is accurate to within about 10\% for typical oceanic conditions.},

	doi = {10.1007/BF00712389},
	abstract = {The part that sea spray plays in the air-sea transfer of heat and moisture has been a controversial question for the last two decades. With general circulation models (GCMs) suggesting that perturbations in the Earth's surface heat budget of only a few W m−2 can initiate major climatic variations, it is crucial that we identify and quantify all the terms in that heat budget. Thus, here we review recent work on how sea spray contributes to the sea surface heat and moisture budgets. In the presence of spray, the near-surface atmosphere is characterized by a droplet evaporation layer (DEL) with a height that scales with the significant-wave amplitude. The majority of spray transfer processes occur within this layer. As a result, the DEL is cooler and more moist than the atmospheric surface layer would be under identical conditions but without the spray. Also, because the spray in the DEL provides elevated sources and sinks for heat and moisture, the vertical heat fluxes are no longer constant with height. We use Eulerian and Lagrangian models and a simple analytical model to study the processes important in spray droplet dispersion and evaporation within this DEL. These models all point to the conclusion that, in high winds (above about 15 m/s), sea spray begins to contribute significantly to the air-sea fluxes of heat and moisture. For example, we estimate that, in a 20-m/s wind, with an air temperature of 20°C, a sea surface temperature of 22°C, and a relative humidity of 80\%, the latent and sensible heat fluxes resulting from the spray alone will have magnitudes of order 150 and 15 W/m2, respectively, in the DEL. Finally, we speculate on what fraction of these fluxes rise out of the DEL and, thus, become available to the entire marine boundary layer.},

We present a unified boundary layer model for (K10), which takes account of both the wave field and spray production, and asymptotes to the growing wind wave state in the absence of spray. The theoretical development is based on an air-sea system with shear layers in both fluids and contains three constants that must be determined empirically. This is done using data from observations, and the resulting behavior is interpreted in terms of spray. A feature of the results is the prediction of a broad maximum inK10. For a spray velocity of 9 m s  1 , it is found that a maximum of K10 2.0 10  3 occurs for a 10-m wind speed,u10 40 m s  1 , in agreement with recent GPS sonde data in tropical cyclones. ThusK10is ‘‘capped’’ at its maximum value for all higher wind speeds expected. A physically based model, where spray droplets are injected horizontally into the airflow and maintained in suspension by air turbulence, gives qualitatively similar results. The effect of spray is also shown to flatten the sea surface by transferring energy to longer wavelengths.},

The paper briefly discusses the operation of the DELFT3D-FLOW module, presents the key features of the formulations used to model both suspended and bedload transport of noncohesive sediment, and describes the implemented morphological updating scheme. The modeling of the three-dimensional effects of waves is also discussed. Following the details of the implementation, the results of a number of validation studies are presented. The model is shown to perform well in several theoretical, laboratory, and real-life situations. © Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Laboratory studies have been conducted in two circular wind wave flumes to investigate the relationship between air-sea transfer velocities of weakly soluble, nonreactive gases and wind-generated surface waves over clean water surfaces and in the presence of surface films. Detailed surface wave measurements have been made using a scanning laser slope gauge. In the circular tanks, longer gravity waves (wavenumber below 12 rad/m) are hardly affected by surfactant, while shorter waves (above 100 rad/m) are significantly reduced. With higher surfactant concentrations, waves above 200-300 rad/m may be completely eliminated. Because of the absence of narrow-banded fetch-limited gravity waves, the wave fields in the circular tanks are significantly different from those in linear wind wave flumes. At a given wind friction velocity, the transfer velocity may decrease by as much as 60\% because of surface films. Regardless of the surfactant concentrations, the transfer velocity shows a reasonable correlation with the total mean square slope and with the mean square slope of shorter wind waves (wavenumber above 200 rad/m). However, it shows a poor correlation with the mean square slope of longer wind waves (wavenumber below 50 rad/m). These observations suggest that short wind waves play an important role in air-sea gas exchange.},

	abstract = {The typically observed gravitational circulation in estuaries with lateral variations in bathymetry consists of a combined distribution of vertically and horizontally sheared flows. The distribution features inflow at depth and outflow at the surface and along the sides. However, theoretical results of density-driven exchange flows dominated by frictional effects display a laterally sheared distribution with inflow occupying the deepest portion of the cross-section and outflow over the shoals. The main purpose of this investigation was to obtain observational evidence in support of theoretical results. A tidal cycle survey was conducted on February 24, 2009, to collect current velocity and hydrographic profile data along a cross-estuary transect. Observations from Hillsborough Bay were compared qualitatively to numerical model and analytical solution results. The observed residual exchange flow pattern compared favorably with the results from a numerical model and an analytical solution that used a condition controlled by friction. The relative importance of friction was explored at tidal and subtidal timescales. Intratidally, frictional influences were observed in the spatial distribution of tidal current amplitude and phase, as well as in potential energy anomaly (stratification) variations. Subtidally, frictional influences were observed through the spatial distributions of tidally averaged stratification, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and eddy viscosity values. The main finding of this study was that relatively weak tidal currents ({\textless}0.3 m/s) can still produce dominant frictional influences in the dynamics. Results indicated that bathymetry shaped by rather wide shoals and relatively narrow channel mold the frictionally dominated, laterally sheared net flow. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this work we seek to quantify the effectiveness of Taylor’s hypothesis on the field scale using water vapour as a passive tracer. A horizontally orientated Raman lidar is used to capture the humidity field in space and time above an agricultural region in Switzerland. High resolution wind speed and direction measurements are conducted simultaneously allowing for a direct test of Taylor’s hypothesis at the field scale. Through a wavelet decomposition of the lidar humidity measurements we show that the scale of turbulent motions has a strong influence on the applicability of Taylor’s hypothesis. This dependency on scale is explained through the use of dimensional analysis. We identify a ‘persistency scale’ that can be used to quantify the effectiveness of Taylor’s hypothesis, and present the accuracy of the hypothesis as a function of this non-dimensional length scale. These results are further investigated and verified through the use of large-eddy simulations.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the exchange of momentum between the atmosphere and ocean using data collected from four oceanic field experiments. Direct covariance estimates of momentum fluxes were collected in all four experiments and wind profiles were collected during three of them. The objective of the investigation is to improve parameterizations of the surface roughness and drag coefficient used to estimate the surface stress from bulk formulas. Specifically, the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) 3.0 bulk flux algorithm is refined to create COARE 3.5. Oversea measurements of dimensionless shear are used to investigate the stability function under stable and convective conditions. The behavior of surface roughness is then investigated over a wider range of wind speeds (up to 25 m s−1) and wave conditions than have been available from previous oversea field studies. The wind speed dependence of the Charnock coefficient α in the COARE algorithm is modified to , where m = 0.017 m−1 s and b = −0.005. When combined with a parameterization for smooth flow, this formulation gives better agreement with the stress estimates from all of the field programs at all winds speeds with significant improvement for wind speeds over 13 m s−1. Wave age– and wave slope–dependent parameterizations of the surface roughness are also investigated, but the COARE 3.5 wind speed–dependent formulation matches the observations well without any wave information. The available data provide a simple reason for why wind speed–, wave age–, and wave slope–dependent formulations give similar results—the inverse wave age varies nearly linearly with wind speed in long-fetch conditions for wind speeds up to 25 m s−1.},

A comparison between different subgrid scale models has been carried out. The study is concerned with the non-rotating and unstratified flows. The results of the simulation for an oscillatory backward facing (BFS) flow are presented in case of an expanding flume based on a one-length scale approach and a two-length scale approach. Three subgrid scale (SGS) models have been tested: Smagorinsky SGS model (Smagorinsky, J., (1963). General circulation experiments with the primitive equations, I. the basic experiments. Monthly Weather Review, 91(3), 99-164), Uittenbogaard SGS model (Uittenbogaard, R.E., and van Vossen, B., (2004). Subgrid-scale model for quasi-2D turbulence in shallow water. Shallow Flows. Jirka and Uijttewaal (Eds.), Taylor \& Francis Group, London, ISBN 90 5809 700 5) and a proposed two-length scale approach. The first two models are considered to be a one-length scale models. A simulation without a subgrid scale model for the horizontal mixing has also been conducted. In all simulations, a quadratic friction model parameterizes the dissipation produced by the 3D-subdepth scale turbulence. The two-length scale concept uses a newly mixing length formulation for the quasi-2D turbulence and doesn't depend on the filter width in contrast to the one-length scale approach, in which the mixing length is function of the filter width. The outputs of the HLES-KULeuven module have been compared with the experimental data taken from Stelling, G.S., and Wang, L.X., (1984). Experiments and computations on separating flow in an expanding flume. Dept. Civil Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Report 2-84.). The two-length scale approach has been validated with experimental data from SERC Flood Channel Facility at HR Wallingford. In general, there is a qualitative agreement with the experimental data. It has also been found that the two-length scale approach produces more elongated and less isotropic vortex than the one-length scale models. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The first example, simulated both with DNS and LES, is the flow in a low-pressure turbine cascade with wakes passing periodically through the cascade channel. In this situation, the laminar-turbulent transition of the boundary layers on the blade surfaces, which is strongly influenced by the passing wakes, is of special interest. Next, LES of the flow past the Ahmed body is presented, which is a car model with slant back. In spite of the fairly simple geometry, the flow around the model has many features of the complex, fully 3D flow around real cars. The third example, for which LES is presented, is the flow past a surface mounted circular cylinder of height-to-diameter ratio of 2.5. In this case also complex 3D flow develops with interaction of various vortices behind the cylinder. By means of these examples, the paper shows that complex turbulent flows of engineering relevance can be predicted realistically by DNS and LES, albeit at large cost. The methods are particularly suited and superior to RANS methods for situations where unsteadiness like shedding and large-scale structures dominate the flow, and DNS has evolved into an important tool for studying transition mechanisms. ?? 2005 The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V.

The different physical and chemical properties of the surface of the ocean compared with bulk seawater, and its function as a gateway for molecules to enter the atmosphere or ocean phase, make this an interesting and important region for study. A number of chemical reactions are believed to occur on and in the surface ocean; these may be important or even dominant sources or sinks of climatically active marine trace gases. However, the sea surface, especially the top 1 μm to 1 mm known as the sea-surface microlayer (ssm), is critically undersampled, so to date much of the evidence for such chemistry comes from laboratory and/or modeling studies.

Global Positioning System sondes have been used since 1997 to measure the profiles of the strong winds in the marine boundary layer associated with tropical cyclones. Here we present an analysis of these data, which show a logarithmic increase in mean wind speed with height in the lowest 200 m, maximum wind speed at 500 m and a gradual weakening up to a height of 3 km. By determining surface stress, roughness length and neutral stability drag coefficient, we find that surface momentum flux levels off as the wind speeds increase above hurricane force.

We show that the transfer coefficient ratio holds closely to a level of ∼0.5 even in the highest observed winds, where previous studies have suggested there is a distinct regime change at the air-sea interface. This value is well below the expected threshold value for intense hurricanes of 0.75. Recent three-dimensional model studies also find that the coefficient ratio can be much lower than 0.75, which suggests that other factors such as eyewall and/or vortex dynamics are responsible for the formation of very strong hurricanes.

Infrared imagery of the water surface at incidence angles greater than 70 ° shows multipath reflections for both spilling and plunging waves generated using a programmable wave maker. For the spilling breakers, the multipath signature was initially distinct from the breaking wave front roller signature but then merged to create a single large bright distributed target. For the plunging breakers, the roller and multipath signatures overlapped from the inception of breaking. The radiance of the multipath reflection was higher than the surrounding water for simulated cold sky conditions and lower for a simulated warm sky. A specular double-reflection model successfully predicted the presence of multipath reflection but the magnitude was sensitive to small uncertainties in geometry, wave slope, and input temperatures. The results show that multipath reflection from breaking waves is characteristic of large incidence angle infrared measurements and increases the area and magnitude of the infrared signature of breaking waves compared to the background.},

	abstract = {To understand the effect of residual oil on hydraulic properties and solute dispersive behavior of porous media, miscible displacement column experiments were conducted using two petroleum products (diesel and engine oil) and a sandy soil. The effective water permeability, effective water-filled porosity, and dispersivity were investigated in two-fluid systems of water and oil as a function of residual oil saturation (ROS). At the end of each experiment, the distribution of ending ROS along the sand column was determined by the method of petroleum ether extraction-ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Darcy's Law was used to determine permeability, while breakthrough curves (BTCs) of a tracer, Cl-, were used to calibrate effective porosity and dispersivity. The experimental results indicate that the maximum saturated zone residual saturation of diesel and engine oil in this study are 16.0\% and 45.7\%, respectively. Cl- is found to have no sorption on the solid matrix. Generated BTCs are sigmoid in shape with no evidence of tailing. The effective porosity of sand is inversely proportional to ROS. For the same level of ROS, the magnitude of reduction in effective porosity by diesel is close to that by engine oil. The relative permeability of sand to water saturation decreases with increasing amount of trapped oil, and the slope of the relative permeability-saturation curve for water is larger at higher water saturations, indicating that oil first occupies larger pores, which have the most contribution to the conductivity of the water. In addition, the reduction rate of relative permeability by diesel is greater than that by engine oil. The dispersivity increases with increasing ROS, suggesting that the blockage of pore spaces by immobile oil globules may enhance local velocity variations and increase the tortuosity of aqueous-phase flow paths.},

Using time scales that parameterize how long sea spray droplets reside in the air and how quickly they exchange heat and moisture with their environment, I estimate sea spray contributions to the air-sea heat fluxes. To make these estimates, I first develop a new sea spray generation function that predicts more realistic spume production than earlier models. Spray droplets with initial radii between 10 and 300/zm contribute most to the heat fluxes; the vast majority of these are spume droplets. The modeling not only demonstrates how spray droplets participate in the air-sea heat exchange but also confirms earlier predictions that the heat carried by sea spray (especially the latent heat) is an important component of the air-sea heat balance. In my examples, the maximum magnitude heat flux is 33 W/m 2. For winds of the spray latent heat flux for a 20-m/s over 10 m/s, the spray wind is 170 W/m2; the maximum latent heat flux is usually a substantial spray of the interfacial (or turbulent) latent heat flux (estimated from the bulk-aerodynamic equations) and will thus confound measurements of the air-sea transfer coefficient for latent heat.},

The presence of high concentrations of liquid water could have a substantial effect on the transfer of energy to and from the ocean surface in severe weather phenomena such as tropical cyclones. Although observational difficulties have prevented adequate direct measurements, data controlled by the former USSR oceanographic fleet over several years and occasional observations from single cyclones indicate that the lowest 100m of the atmosphere may be cooled by over 5 K in winds above 25 m/sec. A recent analytic study by Betts and Simpson also indicated that evaporation of rainfall could be the major contributor to the boundary layer thermodynamic budget. We present an initial investigation of some of these effects for atmospheric conditions typical of those found in tropical cyclones. A parameterisation in terms of bulk meteorological quantities of the fluxes of heat and moisture to the atmosphere from the evaporation of oceanic spray droplets is developed and applied to an axisymmetric slab model of the tropical cyclone boundary layer. We show that the presence of spray has a major and realistic effect on the model solution structure and that without spray the boundary layer evolves in an unrealistic manner. The effects of rain evaporation are also considered, and are shown to be potentially of a similar magnitude to those of sea spray.},

We plot each concentration distribution with the Andreas/Fairall spray generation function for that wind speed to display the production velocity distribution that is required for them to be compatible. The comparison shows that the equilibrium assumption is not consistent with this spray generation function. As an alternative, we try a spray concentration function from the literature and find that it represents the data well for moderate to high wind speeds. Using the compiled data, we then extend this concentration function to the very high wind speeds that generate spume droplets. This function has a stronger dependence on wind speed and a longer tail than the concentration function for jet and film droplets produced by bursting bubbles in whitecaps. To validate these concentration functions, we use a simple ice accretion model with weather data and icing observations from two offshore platforms. The results show that moderate‐to‐high wind speeds that generate film and jet droplets result in small ice accumulations. However, larger spume droplets created at very high wind speeds produce high icing rates. The spray generation function that is consistent with the equilibrium assumption has a median volume droplet radius characteristic of jet droplets for moderate and high wind speeds and a radius that is characteristic of spume droplets at very high speeds.

	abstract = {Flows between ocean and marginal sea basins are often connected by narrow channels and shallow sills. In this study, we address the effect of lateral and vertical geometric constrictions on mixing and hydraulic control. We conduct a set of numerical experiments of the lock-exchange problem in the presence of lateral and vertical contractions. Large eddy simulations (LES) are carried out using the high-order non-hydrostatic spectral element model Nek5000. A spanwise-averaged 2D non-hydrostatic model, denoted SAM, is also employed. Comparison between 2D and 3D models are conducted on the basis of the shape of the density interface and the time evolution of the background potential energy that quantifies the cumulative effects of the stratified mixing in the system. LES indicates that an S-shaped channel induces the highest amount of mixing possibly due to the additional shears caused by the centrifugal force. Vertical and horizontal constrictions enhance mixing by the trapping and breaking of the internal waves in between the obstacles. On the other hand, vertical and horizontal constrictions overlapping with each other restrain the rate of the exchange flow, reduce vertical shears and the mixing. The lowest mixing is encountered in a \{n-ary logical or\}-shaped channel. It is also found that SAM appears to be accurate in identifying the hydraulic control points due to both horizontal and vertical constrictions. A good agreement is found between SAM and inviscid two-layer theory regarding the steady-state location of the density interface. However SAM overestimates mixing with respect to LES since overturning eddies tend to merge in 2D, while they break down into smaller scales in 3D. SAM is then further tested a realistic application to model the flow in the Bosphorus Strait. Here, the main challenges of using SAM revolved around a non-trivial reduction of 3D geometry to a 2D mapping function, and excessive diffusion with simple closures. The realism of SAM improves significantly using a comprehensive turbulence closure of Very Large Eddy Simulation, VLES. In conclusion, exchange flows in narrow straits pose significant computational challenges due to the details of domain geometry and their impact on mixing. SAM with the VLES turbulence closure appears to be an attractive modeling tool for a first-order assessment of dynamical problems involving mixing and hydraulic effects. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The automated procedures serve as a safety net for quality controlling data. A number of special flags are developed representing a variety of potential problems such as inconsistencies between different tower levels and the flux error due to fluctuations of aircraft height. The tests are implemented by specifying critical values for parameters representing each specific error. The critical values are developed empirically from experience of applying the tests to real turbulent time series. When these values are exceeded, the record is flagged for further inspection and comparison with the rest of the concurrent data. The inspection step is necessary to either verify an instrumentation problem or identify physically plausible behavior. The set of tests is applied to tower data from the Risø Air Sea Experiment and Microfronts95 and aircraft data from the Boreal Ecosystem–Atmosphere Study.},
