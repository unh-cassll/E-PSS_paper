	abstract = {Image analysis techniques are used for retrieving water surface elevation fields spatially and temporally from CCD-images and CCD-image-sequences. The technique proposed herein utilizes binocular stereogrammetry to recover topographic information from a sequence of synchronous, overlapping video images. The method used differs from the traditional stereo-photogrammetric analysis of a single stereo-pair because the use of video allows for a continuous sequence of stereo-images to be digitally sampled and analyzed. For data acquisition two synchronized progressive-scan cameras were used. A partially supervised 3-D stereo system (called WASS, Wave Acquisition Stereo System) is shown here. It is used to reconstruct the 3-D shape of water surface waves, acquired at frame rate, with small computational time needed. The stereo method is presented, including the derivation of a relationship relating the geometry of the stereo rig and the expected errors. Finally, the 3-D calculated scattered points give the complete spatio-temporal distribution of the water surface elevations. The measurable length-scales depend on the pixel resolution, the triangulation accuracy, and the acquisition frame rate. Limitations in the stereo measurements are also discussed. Two experiments to test and to demonstrate the system took place: one on the Venice lagoon, north of the city of Venice in September 2004 and the second on the coast of California at San Diego in December 2005. For the second experiment, qualitative and quantitative intercomparisons of the stereo-matching and in-situ sensor measurements are presented. All the measurements of water surface waves indicate that the proposed approach is both accurate and applicable for measuring water surface waves. Moreover, shape estimates are accurately and extremely dense both in space and time, and the remote location of the instruments alleviates some difficulties associated with in situ instrumentation.},

	abstract = {Stereo 3D reconstruction of ocean waves is gaining more and more popularity in the oceanographic community and industry. Indeed, recent advances of both computer vision algorithms and computer processing power now allow the study of the spatio-temporal wave field with unprecedented accuracy, especially at small scales. Even if simple in theory, multiple details are difficult to be mastered for a practitioner, so that the implementation of a sea-waves 3D reconstruction pipeline is in general considered a complex task. For instance, camera calibration, reliable stereo feature matching and mean sea-plane estimation are all factors for which a well designed implementation can make the difference to obtain valuable results. For this reason, we believe that the open availability of a well tested software package that automates the reconstruction process from stereo images to a 3D point cloud would be a valuable addition for future researches in this area. We present WASS (http://www.dais.unive.it/wass), an Open-Source stereo processing pipeline for sea waves 3D reconstruction. Our tool completely automates all the steps required to estimate dense point clouds from stereo images. Namely, it computes the extrinsic parameters of the stereo rig so that no delicate calibration has to be performed on the field. It implements a fast 3D dense stereo reconstruction procedure based on the consolidated OpenCV library and, lastly, it includes set of filtering techniques both on the disparity map and the produced point cloud to remove the vast majority of erroneous points that can naturally arise while analyzing the optically complex nature of the water surface. In this paper, we describe the architecture of WASS and the internal algorithms involved. The pipeline workflow is shown step-by-step and demonstrated on real datasets acquired at sea.},

The method, known as polarimetric slope sensing (PSS), uses the relationship between surface orientation and the change in polarization of reflected light to infer the instantaneous two-dimensional slope across the field-of-view of an imaging polarimeter. For unpolarized skylight, the polarization orientation and degree of linear polarization of the reflected skylight provide sufficient information to determine the local surface slope vectors. A controlled laboratory experiment was carried out in a wave tank with mechanically generated gravity waves. A second study was performed from a pier on the Hudson River, near Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. We demonstrated that the two-dimensional slope field of short gravity waves could be recovered accurately without interfering with the fluid dynamics of the air or water, and water surface features appear remarkably realistic. The combined field and laboratory results demonstrate that the polarimetric camera gives a robust characterization of the fine-scale surface wave features that are intrinsic to wind-driven airsea interaction processes.},

Given the covered area ranging from centimeters to kilometers, such sensors are now a valuable tool for ocean and coastal observations. In this paper, we intercompare spatio-temporal wind wave data acquired with two state-of-the-art techniques, namely the stereo wave imaging and the X-band marine radar. The comparison was performed by operating the two instruments on an oceanographic research platform during a crossing-sea condition. We analyzed the statistical properties of the wave field, and its directional and omni-directional energy distributions. From our analysis, we suggest that stereo data can be exploited to find the best radar Modulation Transfer Function and scale factor needed to estimate wave parameters. Moreover, the fusion of the two systems will allow to broaden the scales covered by any one measurement, and to retrieve reliable directional wave spectra from short (∼1 m) to mid-wavelengths (∼100 m).},

Links Historical Developments to Current Applications and Future Innovations

This book starts with a general description of light and continues with a complete exploration of polarized light, including how it is produced and its practical applications. The author incorporates basic topics, such as polarization by refraction and reflection, polarization elements, anisotropic materials, polarization formalisms (Mueller–Stokes and Jones) and associated mathematics, and polarimetry, or the science of polarization measurement.

New to the Third Edition:


A new introductory chapter 


Chapters on: polarized light in nature, and form birefringence


A review of the history of polarized light, and a chapter on the interference laws of Fresnel and Arago—both completely re-written


A new appendix on conventions used in polarized light


New graphics, and black-and-white photos and color plates


Divided into four parts, this book covers the fundamental concepts and theoretical framework of polarized light. Next, it thoroughly explores the science of polarimetry, followed by discussion of polarized light applications. The author concludes by discussing how our polarized light framework is applied to physics concepts, such as accelerating charges and quantum systems. 

Building on the solid foundation of the first two editions, this book reorganizes and updates existing material on fundamentals, theory, polarimetry, and applications. It adds new chapters, graphics, and color photos, as well as a new appendix on conventions used in polarized light. As a result, the author has re-established this book’s lofty status in the pantheon of literature on this important field.},

To meet this need, exciting new measurement methodologies now provide the opportunity to enhance present knowledge of sea surface roughness, especially at the microscale. In this context, two intensive field experiments using R/P Floating Instrument Platform were staged within the Office of Naval Research's Radiance in a Dynamic Ocean (RaDyO) field program in the Santa Barbara Channel and in the central Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii. As part of this program, our team gathered and analyzed a comprehensive suite of sea surface roughness measurements designed to provide optimal coverage of fundamental optical distortion processes associated with the air-sea interface. This contribution describes the ensemble of instrumentation deployed. It provides a detailed documentation of the ambient environmental conditions that prevailed during the RaDyO field experiments. It also highlights exciting new sea surface roughness measurement capabilities that underpin a number of the scientific advances resulting from the RaDyO program. For instance, a new polarimetric imaging camera highlights the complex interplay of wind and surface currents in shaping the roughness of the sea surface that suggests the traditional Cox-Munk framework is not sufficient. In addition, the breaking crest length spectral density derived from visible and infrared imagery is shown to be modulated by the development of the wavefield (wave age) and alignment of wind and surface currents at the intermediate (dominant) scale of wave breaking.},

	abstract = {Ocean waves are significantly damped by biogenic surfactants, which accumulate at the sea surface in every ocean basin. The growth, development, and breaking of short wind-driven surface waves are key mediators of the air–sea exchange of momentum, heat and trace gases. The mechanisms through which surfactants suppress waves have been studied in great detail through careful laboratory experimentation in quasi-one-dimensional wave tanks. However, the spatial scales over which this damping occurs in structurally complex surfactant slicks on the real ocean have not been resolved. Here, we present the results of field observations of the spatial response of decimetre- to millimetre-scale waves to biogenic surfactant slicks. We found that wave damping in organic material-rich coastal waters resulted in a net (spatio-temporally averaged) reduction of approximately 50\% in wave slope variance relative to the open ocean for low to moderate wind speeds. This reduction of wave slope variance is understood to result in a corresponding reduction in momentum input to the wave field. This significant effect had thus far evaded quantification due in large part to the enormous range of scales required for its description—spanning the sea surface microlayer to the ocean submesoscale.},

Surface elevation spectra calculated at 10 m were shoaled by using linear wave theory. The total variance of stations between 10- and 3-m depth are typically predicted with less than 20\% error, although harmonic amplification and other nonlinear effects can lead to significant errors in the prediction at particular frequency bands.

	abstract = {A method is developed for interpreting the statistics of the suns glitter on the sea surface in terms of the statistics of the slope distribution. The method consists of two principal phases: (1) of identifying, from geometric considerations, any point on the surface with the particular slope required for the reflection of the suns rays toward the observer; and (2) of interpreting the average brightness of the sea surface in the vicinity of this point in terms of the frequency with which this particular slope occurs. The computation of the probability of large (and infrequent) slopes is limited by the disappearance of the glitter into a background consisting of (1) the sunlight scattered from particles beneath the sea surface, and (2) the skylight reflected by the sea surface.The method has been applied to aerial photographs taken under carefully chosen conditions in the Hawaiian area. Winds were measured from a vessel at the time and place of the aerial photographs, and cover a range from 1 to 14 m sec-1. The effect of surface slicks, laid by the vessel, are included in the study. A two-dimensional Gram-Charlier series is fitted to the data. As a first approximation the distribution is Gaussian and isotropic with respect to direction. The mean square slope (regardless of direction) increases linearly with the wind speed, reaching a value of (tan 16)2 for a wind speed of 14 m sec-1. The ratio of the up/downwind to the crosswind component of mean square slope varies from 1.0 to 1.9. There is some up/downwind skewness which increases with increasing wind speed. As a result the most probable slope at high winds is not zero but a few degrees, with the azimuth of ascent pointing downwind. The measured peakedness which is barely above the limit of observational error, is such as to make the probability of very large and very small slopes greater than Gaussian. The effect of oil slicks covering an area of one-quarter square mile is to reduce the mean square slopes by a factor of two or three, to eliminate skewness, but to leave peakedness unchanged.},

These two instruments have been flying on board the ADEOS satellite platform, which assures a very large data set of coincident measurements distributed over all oceans. The glint intensity and pattern is directly related to the wave slope probability function. The slope distribution model developed by Cox and Munk (1954) more than half a century ago, which is a function of wind speed and direction, permits an excellent fit of the observation. In particular, the modeled mean square slope is in near perfect agreement with that derived from the satellite data. The latter permit, however, a novel analysis of the deviations from a pure Gaussian slope distribution. In particular, it is shown that the skewness is a nonlinear function of the wind speed. A typical glint reflectance in the specular direction is 0.2, which is therefore significantly smaller than, for instance, a typical cloud reflectance. There are large variations with the Sun zenith angle, however, that are easily accounted for with a simple formula. The glint reflectance allows an estimate of the wind speed that is highly correlated with the independent measurement from the scatterometer, with an estimated error less than 1 m s/sup -1/. The multidirectional reflectance measurements from POLDER also permit the retrieval of the wind direction, albeit only in favorable conditions depending on the respective orientation of the view and wind vectors},

Predictions of the (nondirectional) bottom pressure spectrum at sea and swell frequencies (0.04–0.30 Hz), based on the velocity measurements and linear theory, are in excellent agreement with directly measured pressure. The general level of agreement (gain errors less than 5\%) is somewhat better than results reported from similar (but spanning a much wider range of conditions ) intercomparison studies using conventional in situ current meters. Observed cross spectra between colocated pressure and horizontal velocity components, frequently used to separate turbulence and wave orbital velocities (assuming that the coherence of wave velocity and pressure is equal to 1), are compared to predictions based on the pressure array data and linear wave theory. The observed and predicted pressure-velocity cross spectra are in excellent agreement and show that large coherence reductions can occur in natural wind waves owing to wave directional spreading effects, despite relatively low turbulence energy levels. Wave radiation stresses, estimated from the velocity measurements, also agree well with estimates extracted from the pressure array data. Overall, the intercomparisons show that the present acoustic Doppler system has directional resolution comparable to a pitch-and-roll buoy, and they suggest that higher-order directional information as well as weak nonlinear properties of natural wind waves may be examined with a slightly modified compact system.},

	abstract = {Directional spreading of ocean waves plays an important role in various aspects of ocean engineering, such as wave-induced loads, nonlinear wave evolution, and wave breaking. Wave following buoys, which are widely deployed across the oceans, offer the potential to measure directional wave properties. To assess the accuracy of directional spreading estimates made using buoy measurements, we compared estimates based on experimentally obtained buoy and wave gauge measurements, first presented in McAllister and van den Bremer (J Phys Oceanogr 50:399–414, 2020) Buoy and gauge measurements were recorded at the same locations and in identical sea states, allowing for a like-for-like comparison. We examine experiments with both following (unimodal in direction) and crossing (bimodal in direction) sea states. In addition to this, we use synthetic wave data to investigate the effects of wave generation and nonlinearity on spreading estimates. Our results show that while directional estimates produced using buoy measurements are reasonably accurate in following sea states, they struggle to identify distinct directional peaks in crossing sea states. We find that spreading estimates made using buoy measurements tend to underestimate the degree of directional spreading by approximately \$\$9-14{\textbackslash}\%\$\$in following sea states, which is most apparent in narrowly spread conditions.},

The six independent wave measurement systems reported hourly estimates of the frequency spectra, and when applicable, the four Fourier directional components. The integral wave parameters showed general agreement among the five sensors compared to the neighboring Datawell Directional Waverider, with the Inclinometer and the Watchman performing similarly to the more sophisticated 3DMG, HIPPY, and Triaxys sensor packages. As the Hm0 increased, all but the Inclinometer were biased low; however, even the Watchman reported reasonable wave measurements up to about 6–7 m, after which the Hm0 becomes negatively biased up to about a meter, comparable to previous studies. The parabolic fit peak spectral wave period, Tpp, results showed a large scatter, resulting from the complex nature of multiple swell wave systems compounded by local wind-sea development, exacerbated by a variable that can be considered as temporally unstable. The three directional sensors demonstrated that NOMAD buoys are capable of measuring directional wave properties along the western US coast, with biases of about 6 to 9 deg, and rms errors of approximately 30 deg. Frequency spectral evaluations found similarities in the shape, but a significant under estimation in the high frequency range. The results from slope analyses also revealed a positive bias in the rear face of the spectra, and a lack of invariance in frequency as suggested by theory.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the directional distribution of a wave field is crucial for a better understanding of complex air–sea interactions. However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of ocean waves, combined with the limitations of existing measurement technologies and analysis techniques, makes it difficult to obtain precise directional information, leading to a poor understanding of this important quantity. This study investigates the potential use of a wavelet-based method applied to GPS buoy observations as an alternative approach to the conventional methods for estimating the directional distribution of ocean waves. The results indicate that the wavelet-based estimations are consistently good when compared to the framework of widely used parameterizations for the directional distribution. The wavelet-based method presents advantages in comparison with the conventional methods, including being purely data-driven and not requiring any assumptions about the shape of the distribution. In addition, it was found that the wave directional distribution is narrower at the spectral peak and broadens asymmetrically at higher and lower scales, particularly sharply for frequencies below the peak. The directional spreading appears to be independent of the wave age across the entire range of frequencies, implying that the angular width of the directional spectrum is primarily controlled by nonlinear wave–wave interactions rather than by wind forcing. These results support the use of the wavelet-based method as a practical alternative for the estimation of the wave directional distribution. In addition, this study highlights the need for continued innovation in the field of ocean wave measuring technologies and analysis techniques to improve our understanding of air–sea interactions. Significance Statement This study presents a wavelet-based technique for obtaining the directional distribution of ocean waves applied to GPS buoy. This method serves as an alternative to conventional methods and is relatively easy to implement, making it a practical option for researchers and engineers. The study was conducted in a highly energetic environment characterized by high wind speeds and large waves, providing a valuable dataset for understanding the dynamics of marine environment in extreme conditions. This research has implications for improving our understanding of directional characteristics of ocean waves, which is crucial for navigation, offshore engineering, weather forecasting, and coastal hazard mitigation. This study also highlights the challenges associated with understanding wave directionality and emphasizes a need for further observations.},

Most are deployed as Lagrangian drifters, so their utility for engineering applications, requiring a nearshore mooring, has remained in question. We evaluated the performance of five moored mini-buoys off the coast of Duck, North Carolina at Field Research Facility (FRF). We collected 8 months of data over two deployments; first near the FRF’s 8-m array and then near a Datawell Waverider in 17-m depth. We deployed an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) that measured waves and currents, and compared it to the nearby operational system as a performance benchmark for the mini-buoys. The mini-buoys performed well, with statistics similar to the benchmark for wave frequency spectra and spectral parameters, and they outperformed the benchmark on directional parameters. However, mini-buoy communication was sometimes interrupted by tilting or submersion, which manifested as low-frequency noise or drop-outs. If a mooring was taut, forced by winds or currents and exacerbated by tangled lines or shallower depths, then mini-buoys were more susceptible to communication issues. Overall, these issues were rare; thus, mini-buoys were found to be appropriate for many applications.},

This paper endeavors to expand on the body of laboratory wave modulation data and extend the investigation in support of the radar remote sensing of ocean surface waves. Measurements were made in the University of Miami's surge-structure-atmosphere interaction facility in the air-sea interaction saltwater tank wind-wave tank, with 10 m referenced wind speeds ranging between 5 and 23 m/s and paddle-generated wave steepnesses 'ak' varying between 0.05 {\textless} ak {\textless} 0.3. A polarimetric camera was used to capture high sampling frequency maps of wave slope, yielding spatiotemporal information about short wind-wave behavior [provided as temporal variations in the wavenumber spectrum, where κ ≈ (100-1000) rad/m]. The simultaneous and colocated long wave phase was measured via a side-looking camera. Hydrodynamic modulation transfer function (MTF) phases are found to be in general agreement with established values (between 2 and 10 radians) at the given wind speeds. The positive phase of the modulation places it immediately downwind of the long wave crest, with MTF magnitudes strongest for high wavenumbers at the lowest wind speeds. The results are also presented to show the modulation of gravity-capillary and pure capillary waves as variations in mean square slope over the long wave phase, with peak roughness enhancement found to move upwind of the long wave crest with increasing wind forcing.},

It has been hypothesized that rain's suppression of ocean surface gravity waves and centimeter-scale wave enhancement should alter the nature of air-sea momentum flux, resulting in increased near-surface current. Here, we use field observations to describe this impact and measure the very near-surface current response to rainfall. During heavy rain, surface-roughening ring waves were generated and longer gravity waves were suppressed; immediately following, the magnitude of the near-surface current increased in response to wind forcing, but died as the rain subsided and long waves recovered. These first-of-their-kind field observations indicate that rain reduces ocean wave form drag in favor of tangential stress, resulting in the acceleration of current near the sea surface.},
